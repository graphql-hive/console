# Product Entity

The **Product** type represents physical or _digital items_ available in the catalog. Products are uniquely identified and federated across multiple subgraphs.

## Key Capabilities

### Unique Identification
- Universal Product Code (`upc`) - primary key
- SKU + package combination - composite key
- Learn more about [federation keys](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation)

### Product Data
1. Descriptive metadata (name, package)
2. Physical specifications (dimensions, weight)
3. Business metrics (reviews, creator info)

> **Access Control**: The `hidden` field is marked `@inaccessible` and won't appear in the public schema.

---

**Query Pattern**: Fetch via `product(upc: String!)`
**Variations**: Products can have multiple `variations` for sizes/colors
**Reviews**: Aggregated score available in `reviewsScore` field
