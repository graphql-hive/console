Upgrade graphql-inspector/core to v7 and update the models to be able to handle the new change
objects. GraphQL Inspector now supports directive changes and improves the accuracy of the severity level for several change types. This will improve schema checks to make them more accurate and more complete. See graphql-inspector's changelog for details.
