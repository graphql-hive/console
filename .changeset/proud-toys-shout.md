Emails Service: Debug log emails

When developing Hive, working on Emails service, it is useful to see the output of emails since they will not actually be sent in development.

Now when log level is set to debug, sent emails will be logged.

Reminder: We strongly recommend to disable debug logs in production for performance and security reasons.
