  """
  A date-time string at UTC, such as \`2007-12-03T10:15:30Z\`, is compliant with the date-time format outlined
  in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

  This scalar is a description of an exact instant on the timeline such as the instant that a user account was created.

  This scalar ignores leap seconds (thereby assuming that a minute constitutes 59 seconds). In this respect, it diverges from the RFC 3339 profile.

  Where an RFC 3339 compliant date-time string has a time-zone other than UTC, it is shifted to UTC. For example, the date-time string \`2016-01-01T14:10:20+01:00\` is shifted to \`2016-01-01T13:10:20Z\`.
