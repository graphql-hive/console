 * This migration is going to create a new role for each group of members
 * that have the same scopes but no role assigned.
 *
 * The role will be named "Auto Role {counter}".
 * The counter will be reset for each organization.
 *
 * Completes:
 * https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2023-12-05-member-roles
 *
 * Users won't be affected by this change, as they will still have the same scopes.
