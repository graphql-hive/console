## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- [#8355](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/8355)
  [`b8b4499`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/b8b4499af882ae6f711d6553957105120d98fd31)
  Thanks [@jonathanawesome](https://github.com/jonathanawesome)! - Lab: Add a schema documentation
  pane, opt-in via the new `enableDocs` prop.

  When enabled, a third icon appears in the left rail and opens documentation in the same slot as
  Collections and History: browse root types, types and fields, search across the whole type map
  (including input objects and enum values), and read descriptions, deprecations and argument
  defaults. Builder rows gain an "Open in Docs" context menu entry, and the GraphQL editor hover
  gains an "Open in Docs" link. `renderLaboratory` enables the pane by default, so standalone
  embedders of the UMD bundle get it without passing `enableDocs`.

  `enableDocs` also decides whether introspection asks for descriptions, so a host that supplies
  `defaultSchemaIntrospection` must build it with descriptions itself. Building it with
  `introspectionFromSchema` does that by default.

  **Removed:** the `introspection.schemaDescription` setting and its toggle in the settings dialog.
  It was wired to graphql-js's `descriptions` option rather than `schemaDescription`, and defaulted
  to `false` where graphql-js defaults to `true`, so nothing rendered descriptions and the toggle
  had no discoverable effect. Descriptions now follow `enableDocs`. `render-laboratory` no longer
  maps Yoga's `schemaDescription` option.

  Thanks [@jonathanawesome](https://github.com/jonathanawesome)! - Laboratory: restore preflight
  behaviour that was lost when the lab moved into this package, and stop a script from being able to
  wedge a run.

  - `lab.prompt(title, defaultValue, { placeholder, description })`. **The first argument is now the
    field label rather than the input's placeholder**.
  - `lab.environment.set()` accepts strings, numbers, booleans and `null`; anything else is dropped
    with a warning, since environment values are interpolated into headers as text.
  - New `preflightNotice` prop. The preflight editor warns that scripts run in the reader's browser;
    hosts that share one script between people should say so here.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#8266](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/8266)
  [`5cb4487`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/5cb44871271713c0804b7f9393e5b8c7ad67521e)
  Thanks [@jonathanawesome](https://github.com/jonathanawesome)! - Laboratory: Fix hovers, tooltips
  and several builder defects, and add copy as cURL, a reload-schema button and an introspection
  polling toggle.

  **Added**

  - Copy as cURL in the operation toolbar.
  - A reload-schema button in the builder, which introspects over the network even when a schema was
    supplied by the host, and spins while the request is in flight. It replaces the previous
    "restore default endpoint" button; `restoreDefaultEndpoint` remains available on the API.
  - `introspection.pollSchema` setting to turn off the 5 second introspection poll and refresh the
    schema only on demand.
  - `enableFullScreen` prop (default `true`) so hosts that already fill the viewport can hide the
    full screen control.
  - The Query Plan tab is now always shown, with an empty state explaining that plans appear when
    the gateway returns `extensions.queryPlan`.

  **Fixed**

  - The builder no longer collapses expanded fields while introspection is polling. An unchanged
    schema previously produced a new `GraphQLSchema` on every poll, resetting expansion to the depth
    of the current document.
  - Editor hovers now appear on mouse over, so validation messages and schema documentation are
    readable.
  - Monaco's folding chevrons render as icons instead of empty squares. Font faces are now
    registered on the document, where browsers resolve them, rather than inside the shadow root
    where they are ignored.
  - Response size is shown in real units instead of always reading `0KB`, and is measured in UTF-8
    bytes.
  - Tooltips attached with `asChild` now appear. `Button`, `TooltipTrigger` and `AlertDialogTrigger`
    did not forward refs, leaving the tooltip without an element to anchor to.
  - The builder's tree/list toggle is controlled, cannot be deselected into an empty state, and is
    disabled with an explanation until a search is active.
  - The Query Plan panel no longer throws while rendering when a response body is not JSON.
  - monaco-graphql is initialized once and updated in place, so variables validation registers
    regardless of which editor mounts first and survives an endpoint change.
  - Removed invalid nested buttons in builder and collection rows, which also makes the collection
    edit and delete actions keyboard reachable.
  - The query plan visualization no longer updates state during render.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#8206](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/8206)
  [`481f356`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/481f356e7e0acf509e3e309c992e3c0ba5e9a955)
  Thanks [@jonathanawesome](https://github.com/jonathanawesome)! - Remove the request `retry`
  setting from the laboratory. Retries are the wrong primitive for an interactive GraphQL IDE (the
  user re-runs operations, and schema introspection already polls), and the underlying HTTP executor
  retried on any GraphQL `errors` response while dropping request headers on the retry, so retries
  went out unauthenticated. Existing persisted `retry` values are ignored automatically.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- [#8167](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pull/8167)
  [`6e9a210`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/commit/6e9a21009ca2754b8237da4afac1115d339be8d2)
  Thanks [@mskorokhodov](https://github.com/mskorokhodov)! - Bump bundled `graphql` from `^16.12.0`
  to `^16.14.0` to fix "Unexpected invariant triggered" error in the schema explorer when
  introspecting servers running graphql-js 16.14+. graphql-js 16.14.0 added `DIRECTIVE_DEFINITION`
  to the `@deprecated` directive's introspection locations; the previously bundled 16.12.0 did not
  recognise this enum value, making the Laboratory unusable against any such server.
