# Hive Laboratory

[Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) is a fully open-source schema registry, analytics,
metrics and gateway for [GraphQL federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) and
other GraphQL APIs.

`@graphql-hive/laboratory` is Hive's embeddable, in-browser GraphQL IDE (the "Lab"): an editor and
runner for GraphQL operations, in the spirit of GraphiQL. It powers the Laboratory page inside the
Hive Console and can be embedded into any page that talks to a GraphQL endpoint.

> **Pre-1.0.** The public API (see [`LaboratoryApi`](src/components/laboratory/context.tsx)) is
> still evolving and can change between patch releases.

## Features

- Query builder: click schema fields/arguments to build the operation
- Schema explorer with search (list and tree modes)
- Collections (saved operations) and request history
- Schema documentation pane (opt-in via `enableDocs`), reachable from Builder rows and editor hovers
- Preflight scripts: run JavaScript before a request in a sandboxed Web Worker
- Environment variables with `{{variable}}` interpolation
- Renders a federation query plan when a server includes one in the response `extensions`
  (`extensions.queryPlan`), e.g. [Hive Router](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router) or
  Hive Gateway
- Plugin system for adding tabs, command-palette entries and preflight APIs

## Consumers

This package is storage- and transport-agnostic. It exposes state as props and reports changes via
callbacks; the host decides where data lives.

- **Hive Console** (`packages/web/app`) embeds the `<Laboratory>` React component directly in
  [`target-laboratory-new.tsx`](../../web/app/src/pages/target-laboratory-new.tsx) and wires the
  callbacks to the Hive GraphQL API and `localStorage`.
- **Hive Gateway** serves the Lab as its GraphiQL replacement via
  **`@graphql-hive/render-laboratory`** ([`../render-laboratory`](../render-laboratory)), which
  wraps this package's UMD bundle plus the Monaco workers into a self-contained HTML page for
  `graphql-yoga` servers.
- **Hive Router** embeds this package's UMD bundle (`dist/hive-laboratory.umd.js`) directly at build
  time, generating a static page that calls the `HiveLaboratory.renderLaboratory()` global.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @graphql-hive/laboratory
```

## Usage

Two entry points are exported from [`src/index.tsx`](src/index.tsx):

**`renderLaboratory(el, props)`** mounts the Lab into a DOM node and wires all state to
`localStorage` for you. This is the quickest way to embed it:

```ts
import { renderLaboratory } from '@graphql-hive/laboratory'

renderLaboratory(document.getElementById('root')!, {
  defaultEndpoint: 'https://example.com/graphql'
})
```

**`<Laboratory />`** is the React component when you want to own persistence. Every piece of state
follows the same controlled/uncontrolled contract: a `defaultX` prop seeds the initial value and an
`onXChange` callback fires whenever it changes.

```tsx
import { Laboratory } from '@graphql-hive/laboratory'

function LabPage() {
  return (
    <Laboratory
      theme="dark"
      defaultEndpoint={endpoint}
      onEndpointChange={setEndpoint}
      defaultCollections={collections}
      onCollectionsChange={saveCollections}
      defaultHistory={history}
      onHistoryChange={saveHistory}
      // ...tabs, operations, env, preflight, settings, plugins
    />
  )
}
```

The full prop surface (endpoint, collections, operations, history, tabs, env, preflight, settings,
tests, plugins, plus granular `onXCreate`/`onXUpdate`/`onXDelete` callbacks and a `permissions`
object) is defined by [`LaboratoryApi`](src/components/laboratory/context.tsx). Treat that interface
as the source of truth rather than this README.

### Operations and tabs

`operations` is the pool of documents; `tabs` is what is open in the tab bar. They are separate
stores, so a host that seeds one must seed the other: an operation with no tab pointing at it is
unreachable, and an operation tab whose `data.id` matches no operation renders an empty tab. Seed
`defaultOperations`, `defaultTabs` and `defaultActiveTabId` together, with ids that line up. See
[`dev/operations.ts`](dev/operations.ts) for a worked example.

### Permissions

Pass a `permissions` object to gate actions per resource (`preflight`, `collections`,
`collectionsOperations`) with `read`/`create`/`update`/`delete` flags. Gating is applied in the UI
(controls are hidden/disabled) with a backstop in the operations logic; anything unspecified
defaults to allowed.

### Documentation pane

`enableDocs` adds a documentation icon to the left rail, opening a schema browser in the same slot
as Collections and History. It is off unless you pass it. Builder rows get an "Open in Docs" context
menu entry, and the GraphQL editor hover gets an "Open in Docs" link (the Lab serves that hover
itself when docs are on, instead of monaco-graphql).

The prop also decides whether introspection requests descriptions, since nothing else renders them.
That only reaches introspection the Lab performs itself: if you pass `defaultSchemaIntrospection`,
build it with descriptions or the pane will have nothing to show. `introspectionFromSchema` includes
them by default, so the usual `introspectionFromSchema(buildSchema(sdl))` needs no extra options.

### Styling and rendering

The Lab bundles its own styles and injects them into its shadow root, so there is no CSS file to
import. It is client-side only (it uses Web Workers, Shadow DOM and Monaco), so mount it in the
browser rather than during server-side rendering.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm dev   # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
pnpm build # library build (ES + CJS) and UMD build
pnpm lint  # eslint
```

`pnpm dev` mounts the Lab via [`src/main.tsx`](src/main.tsx) / [`index.html`](index.html), a thin
harness that seeds collections, operations and tabs from [`dev/`](dev) on every load and persists
nothing, so a reload is always the same known state. No backend is required: the Vite dev server
mounts a mock GraphQL endpoint at the same origin (see
[`dev/mock-graphql.ts`](dev/mock-graphql.ts)), which the harness points at by default.

Tests run from the monorepo root (this package has no `test` script):

```bash
# from the repo root
pnpm vitest run packages/libraries/laboratory
```

## Architecture

Each feature is a `useX` hook (state + actions) under [`src/lib`](src/lib), paired with a component
under [`src/components/laboratory`](src/components/laboratory). All the hooks are composed into one
context in [`laboratory.tsx`](src/components/laboratory/laboratory.tsx) and consumed via
`useLaboratory()`.

| Feature                         | Hook (`src/lib`)                       | UI (`src/components/laboratory`)  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Endpoint + schema introspection | `endpoint.ts`                          | (implicit)                        |
| Operations + run/abort          | `operations.ts`, `operations.utils.ts` | `operation.tsx`, `builder.tsx`    |
| Collections                     | `collections.ts`                       | `collections.tsx`                 |
| History                         | `history.ts`                           | `history.tsx`, `history-item.tsx` |
| Preflight scripts               | `preflight.ts`                         | `preflight.tsx`                   |
| Environment variables           | `env.ts`                               | `env.tsx`                         |
| Settings                        | `settings.ts`                          | `settings.tsx`                    |
| Tabs                            | `tabs.ts`                              | `tabs.tsx`                        |
| Query plan                      | `query-plan/`                          | `flow.tsx`                        |

### Style isolation (Shadow DOM)

Because the Lab is embedded into pages it does not control, it renders inside a Shadow DOM
(`ShadowRootContainer` in [`laboratory.tsx`](src/components/laboratory/laboratory.tsx)) and injects
its CSS (Tailwind v4) plus Monaco's CSS inline. This gives two-way isolation from the host page's
styles. A consequence worth knowing: Radix portals (dropdowns, tooltips, dialogs) must target the
Lab's `container` (exposed on the context) rather than `document.body`, or they render unstyled.

The UI is built on shadcn/Radix primitives ([`src/components/ui`](src/components/ui)), Monaco, and
`@tanstack/react-form`.

## Plugins

A plugin can add tabs, command-palette commands, and objects injected into the preflight sandbox.
See [`LaboratoryPlugin`](src/lib/plugins.ts) for the shape and
[`src/plugins/target-env.tsx`](src/plugins/target-env.tsx) for a worked example (the Target
Environment plugin used by Hive Console). Register plugins via the `plugins` prop.
