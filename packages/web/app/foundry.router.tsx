/**
 * A stand-in router for previews.
 *
 * `Link` throws without router context, and the real router in `src/router.tsx` is unusable here:
 * it pulls in every page, and with them `@/env/frontend`, which validates an environment foundry
 * does not have.
 *
 * `RouterContextProvider` looks like the obvious fit but is not enough. It supplies the router
 * without ever resolving a location, so `state.matches` stays empty and `Link`'s `useMatch` fails
 * with "Could not find a nearest match!". Only `RouterProvider` initialises matches, and it renders
 * the matched route rather than its children.
 *
 * So the root route renders whatever is in `PreviewSlot`, and the provider puts the preview's
 * children there. `RouterProvider` gets its normal lifecycle; the canvas still shows the preview.
