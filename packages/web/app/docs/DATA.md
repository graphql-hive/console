# Data loading in `console`

How a page's data gets requested, cached and kept fresh, and the recipe for giving a page a loader.
The client is [urql](https://urql.dev) with graphcache (`src/lib/urql.ts`, `src/lib/urql-cache.ts`);
the requests start in [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) loaders (`src/routes/`), and
pages read them through `useQuery`. Routing itself is in [ROUTER.md](./ROUTER.md).

## Two patterns and one rule

**1. A route loads; a page reads.** A route's loader runs every document its page will read, with
the variables the page will use, through `loadQuery` (`src/lib/route-utils.ts`). The page's
`useQuery` for the same document and variables is then a cache hit, or joins the request still in
flight; it never starts one of its own on a first render. On a cold load every document for the
screen starts in one burst as soon as the router has matched, before anything renders, alongside the
viewer and layout documents. Loader data never carries GraphQL data: the page reads through urql, so
mutations, updaters and revalidation reach it the same way they reach everything else. It carries
only what the loader decided, such as a resolved period.

**2. Warm by default; await only to decide.** A loader `void`s `loadQuery` for what the page shows,
and the page renders at once with its regions behind their own loading states. A loader awaits only
when the route must decide before rendering: a permission gate (`requireLayoutFlag`, below), a
section check (`/settings` and `/members` await their page document to see which sections the viewer
may open), a data redirect (`/history` awaits the latest version to redirect to it) or a not-found.
Everything else the route warms starts beside the await, so a cold load pays no extra round trip for
the decision. While an awaiting loader runs, the router shows `PagePending`, a centered spinner,
after 250 ms (`defaultPendingComponent` and `defaultPendingMs` in `src/router.ts`); a load that
finishes inside the delay never shows it. A warmed document the page turns out not to read (the
stats of a target that has no operations yet, the unused schema of a target without usage) is the
accepted cost of not awaiting.

**The rule that makes 1 work: the variables must match.** The loader builds them from `params` and
`loaderDeps` exactly as the page builds them from `useSlugs` and `useSearch`: same shape, same
defaults, and `null` is not `undefined`, because urql keys a request by document and variables.
Anything computed from the URL alone is a pure function both sides call, exported from the page:
`buildGraphQLFilter` for insights, `tracesPageVariables`, `appsVariables`, `proposalsVariables`,
`versionsPageVariables`, and the `*Sections` functions of the settings and members pages. Anything
that also depends on the clock is resolved once, by the loader, and returned as loader data: the
period pages return the period from `loaderPeriod`, with the resolution where a query takes one, and
the overviews return `overviewPeriod()`; the page reads them with `useLoaderData`, so a filter
change after the hour rolls over cannot leave the two on different buckets. `loaderDeps` names the
search params a query takes, so a change to one of them re-runs the loader and a change to any other
(`viewId` on insights) does not. A search param that changes on every keystroke does not belong in
the URL until it settles: the app version's search box writes the URL 500 ms after typing pauses
(`src/components/apps/app-filter.tsx`), so the loader runs once per pause.

## Request policies

- **`cache-first`**, the default of `loadQuery` and of every page `useQuery`: read once per session
  and kept right by the cache. Renames flow through normalization (mutations return `id` and the
  changed fields); creates and deletes go through updaters in `src/lib/urql-cache.ts`. Layout
  documents, settings pages, checks, apps, project alerts and the read-once target pages live here.
- **`cache-and-network` in a loader** (`revalidate(loader)`): show the cache, revalidate on every
  visit. For data that moves on its own: usage (insights, traces, the explorer views, the overviews,
  alert activity) and lists other people change (history, proposals, alert rules, groups, the
  organization and project token sections, SSO). The target's CDN and registry tokens stay
  `cache-first`, since their creates and deletes go through updaters. The page still reads
  `cache-first`; a component's own `useQuery` never carries `cache-and-network` for a document the
  loader loads, since whichever request lands first would then be revalidated a second time by the
  page.
- **Preloads.** `loader.preload` is true when a hover or focus preload runs the loader
  (`defaultPreload: 'intent'`). `revalidate` switches to `cache-first` for it, so a hover only
  warms. The router keeps a preloaded match fresh for 30 s (`defaultPreloadStaleTime`), so on a
  `cache-first` route the click that follows runs no loader and no request. A route that revalidates
  sets `preloadStaleTime: 0`, so the visit that follows a hover still runs its loader.
- **Refresh** is `router.invalidate()`: it re-runs the current matches' loaders, and each loader's
  policy decides what that costs. `useDateRangeController().refreshResolvedRange()` does this, so a
  Refresh button is one call and reloads exactly what its route declared live, recomputing anything
  the loader resolved, such as the period. A poll is the same call on a timer: alert activity runs
  `useInterval(15 s, () => router.invalidate())` (`src/lib/hooks/use-interval.ts`, which never fires
  on mount, since the loader already ran); within a minute the loader's variables repeat and the
  request revalidates, at the roll they change and the page joins the new request.
- **`network-only`** after a mutation whose result no updater can write, to re-execute a list, and
  always explicit: `reexecuteQuery({ requestPolicy: 'network-only' })`. A bare `reexecuteQuery()`
  takes the hook's policy, which is `cache-first` under a loader, and reads the cache. A few
  page-owned `network-only` queries remain where their comments say why: the proposal's changes, a
  group's detail row, the external composition check, the laboratory's current operation.
- An error result is never cached. `loadQuery` resolves with it rather than throwing, the page's
  `useQuery` sees it and renders `QueryError` as before, and a loader redirects only on an explicit
  answer, never on missing data.

## The viewer and the layouts

- `authenticated.tsx` checks the session in `beforeLoad`, so no loader runs for an anonymous
  visitor.
- The `with-header` route's loader loads `ViewerQuery` (`src/components/layouts/queries.ts`: `me`,
  the organizations tree the selectors read, `isCDNEnabled`) and revalidates it at most once a
  minute (`VIEWER_MAX_AGE_MS`). `useViewer()` reads it anywhere under the header. Joins and member
  removals invalidate it through updaters; changes made by other people appear within a minute plus
  a navigation.
- Each layout route warms its entity document (`OrganizationLayoutQuery`, `ProjectLayoutQuery`,
  `TargetLayoutQuery`: slugs, `viewerCan*`, `latestSchemaVersion.id`, `usageRetentionInDays`). A
  page under it reads the same document through `useLayoutQuery(scope)` instead of selecting those
  fields again (the explorer views read their retention there rather than from their own documents),
  and a loader under it can rely on the same cache: the `/history` redirect is a cache read, and
  every permission gate is.
- The user menu's own organization document is a cache hit once the layout has answered, because the
  layout document spreads the menu's fragment.
- The client rides in router context (`createAppRouter({ urqlClient })`); a loader reads it as
  `context.urqlClient` and never imports `@/lib/urql`.

## Gates and defaults in the route

- **Permission gates** are `await requireLayoutFlag.<scope>(loader, ...flags)`
  (`src/lib/route-utils.ts`): the scope's layout document, which the layout route above already
  started, so a cold load dedups into that request and a navigation is a cache hit. It redirects to
  the scope root only when every listed flag is explicitly `false`; missing data or an error admits,
  and the page shows the error. The page documents start beside the gate, not after it, so a viewer
  without the flag may cause one request the server refuses; a viewer with it saves a round trip.
  Target alerts, apps, laboratory and proposals, and project alerts, gate this way.
- **Section checks** (`/settings` under each scope, `/members`) await their page document and
  redirect a hidden section to the first visible one, else the scope root, through the page's
  exported `*Sections(entity)` function, which the nav also renders from. The project settings and
  members pages put a layout-flag gate beside the page document as well.
- **A period lives in the URL.** `defaultRange(range, to)` is the `beforeLoad` that sends a bare URL
  to its default range, so a shared link always says what it shows: the last week for insights,
  traces and the explorer, the last hour for alert activity. Client, coordinate and operation
  insights default in `loaderDeps` without a redirect.
- **Stripe** decides in `beforeLoad` too: the subscription routes redirect to the organization when
  it is not configured.

## A list owns its connection

A paginated list keeps one query and moves its cursor. The field gets `relayPagination()` in
`cacheOptions.resolvers` (`Target.schemaChecks`, `Target.schemaVersions`, `Target.appDeployments`,
`Target.traces`, `AppDeployment.documents`, `Organization.groups`, `Member.accessTokens` and the
other token connections), the list holds `after` in `useResetState(null, [...filters])`, and the
query for the latest cursor reads every page loaded so far, so "load more" is
`setAfter(pageInfo.endCursor)` and a filter change resets the cursor. The route warms the first page
with `after: null` and the filters from `loaderDeps`. The checks side list
(`src/pages/target-checks.tsx`) and the history list are the examples; the token tables page through
`usePagedConnection` over the same merged connection, and the groups list's "Load more" runs the
page query for the next cursor and reads the merged result.

Two fields deliberately have no resolver. `Organization.members` pages with previous and next, so
each page replaces the last. `affectedAppDeployments` is read by the affected deployments page at
`first: 20` and by the check page's preview at `first: 5` under the same filters, and a resolver
would merge the two. One more footgun: the resolver merges every use of a field whose non-cursor
arguments match, so a `first: 1` probe with the same filters reads the merged list, not one item.
Read only its emptiness, or give the probe arguments of its own: the checks probe carries no
`filters` while the list always passes them, so the two never merge. And a document that passes no
cursor (the proposals list) gets the API's first page; a "load more" over it only repeats the
request, so the control is gone until the document pages.

## Loading states

A spinner marks a wait that promises no shape: a button while it saves, a switch while it flips, and
a route while its awaiting loader decides what the page is (`PagePending` / `SectionPending`,
`src/components/layouts/page-pending.tsx`). A region whose shape is known loads behind a skeleton:
`DataTable loading` renders skeleton rows under the real header, stat cards and lists use the
`Skeleton` primitives. A table whose rows are being replaced keeps them, dimmed
(`DataTable refreshing`, or `sorting.loading` for a sort, which also spins the sorted header's
arrow); the page keeps the last settled rows through `useKeepPreviousData` and passes them while the
new ones load.

A page's first result can be a partial cache hit: the layout document already cached the
organization, project or target the page selects, so graphcache answers with those fields, the
missing ones `null`, and `stale: true`, while the request runs. Decide a loading state on the field
the page needs, not on the entity (`!data?.organization?.me?.accessTokens`, not
`!data?.organization?.me`), and treat a stale partial as loading (`fetching || stale`), or an empty
state flashes before the list arrives. A sort or search change has the same shape: the entity is
cached, the new connection is not.

The cold-load sequence is: HTML, then nearly all of the app's JavaScript (the route tree imports
every page eagerly; Monaco alone is lazy), then the session gate, then every loader for the matched
routes in one burst, then the first render with each region's loading state, then the data. Nothing
can start before the route tree has evaluated, which is most of the time to first request in
development; a hover preload moves a route's burst ahead of the click.

## Recipes

### Give a page a loader

1. Export the page's documents from the module that declares them (documents stay under
   `src/{components,lib,pages}` for codegen). Note how the page builds each document's variables;
   move anything computed into a pure function the page calls too, and export it.
2. On the route, `loaderDeps: ({ search }) => ({ ... })` with the search keys a query takes, then
   `loader: loader => { ... }`: read the slugs from `loader.params`, build the variables, and
   `void loadQuery(loader, Document, variables)` per document. Leave the page's `useQuery` as it is,
   minus any request policy.
3. If a mount-time refetch effect existed, delete it. If the data moves on its own, pass
   `revalidate(loader)` to those `loadQuery` calls, set `preloadStaleTime: 0` on the route, and make
   the page's Refresh call `router.invalidate()`.
4. If the route must decide, `await` that one thing: `requireLayoutFlag.<scope>(loader, flag)` for a
   permission, the page document for a section check, `throw redirect(...)` on an explicit answer.
   Start the page documents before the await, not after it.
5. Spec, in `src/routes/<scope>/<area>.spec.ts`: `router.load()` at the URL, then the documents are
   in `client.requests(name)` with the loader's variables and policy; render, then each document is
   requested once, holding a fixture in flight (`new Promise(() => {})`) where the page mounts
   later; a redirect lands in `router.state.location.pathname` with `router.history.length` still 1.

### Put a period in the URL

`beforeLoad: defaultRange(preset.range, '/the/route')`, `loaderDeps` on `from` and `to`, the loader
resolves `loaderPeriod(loader.deps, preset)` and returns it, the page reads it with
`useLoaderData()` for its query and any figure derived from the bounds, and keeps a
`useDateRangeController` only for the picker. Never build the period in the page: the loader and the
page would read the clock at different moments.

### Keep a list right after a mutation

Prefer an updater in `src/lib/urql-cache.ts` (`cache.invalidate(entity, field, args)` or
`updateQuery`) over `reexecuteQuery` in the component. A change to fields of an entity the mutation
returns with its `id` needs neither. Where a component does re-execute, pass `network-only`.

### Add a settings or members section

Add the route under the section's parent with `loader: loader => loadSection(loader, 'thing')`,
warming the section's own document first; add the section to the page's `sections` table and to its
`*Sections` function under its permission (`settingsSections`, `organizationSettingsSections`,
`projectSettingsSections`, `membersSections`). The nav and the loaders agree through that function.

`createTestClient(fixtures)` (`src/lib/testing/urql.ts`) runs the app's own graphcache configuration
over a network that is a lookup by operation name; `requests(name)` lists what reached it. What a
new spec has to know:

- A cache hit is absent from the requests. A `cache-and-network` hit, including a partial hit where
  the layout already cached the entity, is forwarded as `network-only`, so a spec asserts
  "revalidating" as either policy.
- Graphcache strips a variable the document does not declare (the proposal's `timestamp`) from the
  forwarded request; the request key still carries it.
- A promise fixture holds its request in flight, which is how a spec proves the page joined the
  loader's request; an `Error` fixture answers as a failed request.
- Fixtures carry `__typename` on every object below the root and are checked against their document,
  with the missing paths named. Two documents that describe the same entity must agree, since the
  cache normalizes them into one.
- The env, laboratory, SuperTokens and AutoSizer stand-ins live in `src/lib/testing/mocks/`, one
  `vi.mock` line each in the spec, since there is no app-scoped vitest project for `setupFiles`.
- Route specs fake nothing but the clock (`vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ['Date'] })`); timers, the
  router and `waitFor` stay real, and a poll under test gets its interval mocked short. A hook spec
  with no router or DOM waits may fake timers.
