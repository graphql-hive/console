# Using Registry

## CDN Access

With high-availability and multi-zone CDN service based on Cloudflare, Hive allows you to access the registry, through a secured external service, that's always up regardless of Hive services.

To connect your GraphQL Gateway or any other tool with GraphQL Hive you need to generate an access key to our CDN.

Go to the schema view of your target https://app.graphql-hive.com/:org/:project/:target and click "Connect".

GraphQL Hive will now generate a unique key:

## Apollo Federation

You're a programmer (or if you prefer a Software Engineer) so no need to explain the code snippet below. Just two things:

- `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint Hive generated for you in the previous step
- `HIVE_CDN_KEY` - the access key

The `experimental_pollInterval` value is up to you. Apollo Gateway uses 10s (10.000 ms) by default but we think it's better to fetch a supergraph more often.

```typescript
import { createSupergraphSDLFetcher } from '@graphql-hive/client'
import { ApolloGateway } from '@apollo/gateway'
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  experimental_pollInterval: 10_000, // define the poll interval (in ms)
  experimental_updateSupergraphSdl: createSupergraphFetcher({
    endpoint: HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT,
    key: HIVE_CDN_KEY
  })
})

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway
})

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`)
})
```

## Schema Stitching

Stitching could be done in many ways, that's why `@graphql-hive/client` provides generic functions, not something dedicated for stitching. Unfortunately the implementation of gateway + polling is up to you.

Here's an example of how it could work

```typescript
import { createServicesFetcher } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const fetchServices = createServicesFetcher({
  endpoint: process.env.HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT,
  key: process.env.HIVE_CDN_KEY
})

startMyGraphQLGateway({
  // a function that resolves a list of services to stitch them together
  async stitchServices() {
    const services = await fetchServices()

    return services.map(service => {
      return {
        sdl: service.sdl,
        url: service.url,
        checksum: service.id // to check if service's schema was modified
      }
    })
  },
  pollingInSec: 10 // every 10s
})
```

- `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint Hive generated for you in the previous step
- `HIVE_CDN_KEY` - the access key

The `createServicesFetcher` factory function returns another function that is responsible for fetching a list of services from Hive's high-availability endpoint..

The `startMyGraphQLGateway` represents your GraphQL gateway with built-in polling mechanism, in which the `stitchServices` method is called every 10 seconds.

## Other tools

Here's a list of available endpoints:

### Federation

- list of services - `<endpoint>/schema`
- supergraph - `<endpoint>/supergraph`

### Stitching

- list of services - `<endpoint>/schema`

### Single schema project

- Schema Information `<endpoint>/schema`

  Here's an example of how it could work via cURL for a single schema project:

  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/asce7c12-753d-hive-bee-d7f2c803e232/schema \
    --header 'X-Hive-CDN-Key: aabTxbEyC78NvSPQNO+qLrrRnBvODJJ8k4sL/2EtIwc=' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json'
  ```

  Output:

  ```json
  {
    "sdl": "<SDL-here>",
    "date": "2021-08-20T15:16:40.024Z"
  }
  ```

- Raw SDL `<endpoint>/sdl`

  If you wish to get the raw SDL, without a wrapping JSON object, you can specify `/sdl` as suffix to your request.

- Introspection JSON `<endpoint>/introspection`

  If you wish to get the introspection JSON for your GraphQL schema, without a wrapping JSON object, you can specify `/introspection` as suffix to your request.
  This could be useful for tools that need to get the introspection as-is, like GraphQL Codegen, or GraphQL-Config.

- Metadata `<endpoint>/metadata`

  To fetch metadata published along with your GraphQL schema (using `--metadata`), use `/metadata` endpoint

  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/asce7c12-753d-hive-bee-d7f2c803e232/metadata \
    --header 'X-Hive-CDN-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE'
  ```

  The value returned is the value you stored, as JSON, with `Content-Type: application/json` header.
