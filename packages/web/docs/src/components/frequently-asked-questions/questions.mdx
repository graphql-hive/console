## Frequently asked questions

- What does "no vendor lock" mean?

  We value your flexibility and independent decision-making. That means we'll never try to lock you
  out in our ecosystem and we'll continuously add support for other tools and solutions, so that you
  decide what your stack should look like!

- Can GraphQL Hive be self-hosted?

  Yes, the on-premise version (identical to Hive Cloud) is free and open-source. You can read
  “Self-Hosting Hive”(link) in our documentation.

- What counts as GraphQL operation?

  Every GraphQL request that is processed by your GraphQL API and reported to GraphQL Hive. If your
  server receives 1M GraphQL requests, all of them will be reported to Hive (assuming no sampling).

  We’re currently about to finish the process of being SOC-2 Type II complaint and getting the
  certificate.

  years already.
