- Is customising the supergraph possible?

  Changing the supergraph and adjusting it to your needs, either to accommodate extra fields or
  allow for gradual migration from non-federated systems, is easily achievable using
  [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh). It is a first-class citizen in Hive Gateway
  and its outputs are directly usable.

- Can I optimize Hive Gateway's performance for large-scale applications?

  The gateway is designed from ground up with performance in mind, capable of handling even the
  largest of application loads. Using techniques like request caching and deduplication, query
  batching, HTTP compression and more - you're able to tune Hive Gateway exactly to your needs.
