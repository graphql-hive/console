Until now, our GraphQL API was only available internally. But many of you asked for ways to
integrate directly with our platform, whether for integration for in-house tools, scaffolding, or
custom workflows.

You can now integrate directly with our platform using our Public GraphQL API. This means you can:

- Build custom workflows on top of our data and perform actions programatically without the CLI
- Manage users and access tokens
- Get usage information about schema coordinates
- Access new capabilities as we expand the GraphQL schema over time
- Create fine-grained policy based access tokens
