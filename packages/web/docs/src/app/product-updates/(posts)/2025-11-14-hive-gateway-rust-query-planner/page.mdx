# Supercharge Your GraphQL Federation with Rust-Powered Speed

We're thrilled to announce the integration of the **Rust Query Planner** into Hive Gateway, bringing
the lightning-fast performance of Hive Router directly to your Node.js or Bun environment!

## Performance That'll Blow Your Mind

Experience **up to 3x faster query planning per core** and **2x reduced latency** - all while
maintaining 100% compatibility with the Federation-Compatibility Audit. This means your federated
GraphQL architecture stays standards-compliant and interoperable, but now with Rust's unmatched
speed under the hood.

## Easy Integration, Massive Gains

Ready to get started? Head over to our
[Rust Query Planner documentation](/docs/gateway/other-features/rust-query-planner) for step-by-step
setup instructions and unleash the power!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

While the Rust Query Planner delivers incredible speed, it currently doesn't support all Gateway
features. We're hard at work to achieve full compatibility soon! Check out the
[feature comparison](/docs/gateway/other-features/rust-query-planner#compared-to-javascript-query-planner)
for details.
