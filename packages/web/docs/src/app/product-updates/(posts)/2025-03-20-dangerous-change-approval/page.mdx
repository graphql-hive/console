## What’s New?

- **Require approval for dangerous changes** – A new setting, configurable per Schema Target, to
  require approval for dangerous schema changes.

## Feature Details

We are constantly striving to make schema management easier and safer. One issue that isn't
discussed so much is dangerous changes. These are technically safe changes from an API perspective,
but are known to cause issues if systems are not built to handle them. An example is adding a new
enum value.

A new enum value does not break existing values, but if the consumers of the API don't know how to
handle this new case, and don't have a fallback, then it could cause undesirable behavior such as
not rendering an element for an item in a list.

Requiring approval for dangerous changes doesn't entirely solve this issue, because it still
requires the approver to manually verify that the change is safe. But it can help raise awareness
that the change could cause issues and therefore empowers schema owners to better make decisions
about their schema.
