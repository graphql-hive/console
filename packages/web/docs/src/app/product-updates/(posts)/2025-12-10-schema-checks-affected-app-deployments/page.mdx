Schema checks now show which active app deployments would be affected by breaking changes, helping
you understand the real-world impact before deploying schema updates.

## How It Works

When a schema check detects breaking changes, Hive automatically identifies which active app
deployments have operations that use the affected schema coordinates. For each affected deployment,
you'll see:

- The app deployment name and version
- Which specific operations within that deployment use the affected fields

## Example

If you're removing `Query.users`, and your `mobile-app@2.1.0` deployment has operations that query
this field, the schema check will show:

- **Breaking change**: Field `users` was removed from object type `Query`
- **Affected deployment**: `mobile-app` version `2.1.0`
- **Affected operations**: The specific operation names and hashes that use this field

## Benefits

- **Impact assessment**: Understand which client applications would break before deploying
- **Team coordination**: Know which teams need to update their apps before proceeding
- **Risk mitigation**: Make informed decisions about breaking changes

Only **active** app deployments (published and not retired) are analyzed. Pending and retired
deployments are not included.
