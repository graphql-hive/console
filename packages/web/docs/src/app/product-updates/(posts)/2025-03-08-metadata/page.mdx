## What’s New?

- **Linkable `@meta` directive** – A federation compatible, `@link`-able schema to add metadata and
  enhance functionality of your schema.

## Feature Details

One of the most convincing reasons to use GraphQL that it's self documenting. Hive takes this a step
further by defining a convenient and type safe way to add key-value metadata to your schema. The
`@meta` directive is the first directive we've added to a new Federation 2.x compatible set of Hive
features. To opt-in, add a Federation `link` directive to your schema definition:

```graphql
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.graphql-hive.com/hive/v1.0", import: ["@meta"])
```

Metadata is useful for a variety of cases:

- Indicating granular ownership e.g. `@meta(name: "owner", content: "console-team")`
- Adding contact information e.g. `@meta(name: "contact", content: "#hive-channel")`
- Defining field importance e.g. `@meta(name: "priority", content: "tier-1")`
- Defining domains e.g. `@meta(name: "domain", content: "users")`

... and more.

Putting it all together, an example schema using Hive's metadata might look like:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/link/v1.0")
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3")
  @link(url: "https://specs.graphql-hive.com/hive/v1.0", import: ["@meta"])
  @meta(name: "owner", content: "noreply@the-guild.dev")

directive @meta(
  name: String!
  content: String!
) repeatable on SCHEMA | OBJECT | INTERFACE | FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  user: User @meta(name: "domain", content: "accounts") @meta(name: "priority", content: "tier-1")
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  ssn: String @meta(name: "classification", content: "pii")
}
```

Currently, metadata can be viewed from Hive’s explorer page and can be used to filter the explorer
view. And we expect there will be even more features built around this metadata in the future as
Hive continues to expand.
