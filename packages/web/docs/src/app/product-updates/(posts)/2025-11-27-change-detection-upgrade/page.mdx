Breaking change detection is complicated, but it's an incredibly valuable tool for any API. In our
latest release, we upgraded this detection to make breaking changes even more accurate and provide a
more complete set of changes for schema checks.

These have been highly requested features, but our hope is that this change goes mostly unnoticed
because that means it's working and that the changes are tracked accurately.

The technical set of changes are:

- `FieldDeprecationRemoved` severity is changing from "dangerous" to "non-breaking". This is because
  deprecation does not impact behavior.
- `InputFieldAdded` is now "non-breaking" IF a default value is set for the input. Previously only
  nullability was taken into account. This is because the default value will be provided
  automatically, so non-nullable inputs still don't need passed by clients.
- A redundant DeprecationAdded and DeprecationRemoved change was removed.
- And `DirectiveUsage` changes are being tracked. E.g. `DirectiveUsageEnumRemoved` and
  `DirectiveUsageObjectAdded`. A similar set of usage events were added for arguments as well.

This upgrade also lays the foundation for the upcoming feature, schema proposals, which is powered
by [GraphQL Inspector](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector) for change capture and rebasing
changes on top of schemas.
