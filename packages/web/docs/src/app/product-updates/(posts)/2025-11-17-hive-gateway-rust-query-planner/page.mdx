We're thrilled to announce the integration of our
[Rust Query Planner into Hive Gateway](/docs/gateway/other-features/rust-query-planner), bringing
the lightning-fast performance of [Hive Router](/docs/router) directly to your Node.js, Bun, and
Deno environments!

This integration was made possible through our dedicated work on both Hive Gateway and Hive Router,
ensuring everything works great together. We leveraged [napi.rs](https://napi.rs/) to create a
cross-platform Node addon that supports Node.js, Bun, and Deno effortlessly.

## Performance That'll Blow Your Mind

Experience **up to 3x faster query planning per core** and **2x reduced latency** - beating Apollo
Router by almost 2x - all while maintaining 100% compatibility with the Federation-Compatibility
Audit. This means your federated GraphQL architecture stays standards-compliant and interoperable,
but now with Rust's unmatched speed under the hood.

The following results benchmark a scenario runing 4 subgraphs and a GraphQL gateway with Federation
spec, and runs a heavy query. It's being executed with a constant amount of VUs over a fixed amount
of time.

## Full JavaScript Ecosystem Support

One of the key advantages of this integration is that it preserves the full power of the JavaScript
ecosystem. All your existing plugins, integrations, and tools continue to work seamlessly - from
Envelop and Yoga plugins to custom Gateway plugins. You get the best of both worlds: Rust's
performance under the hood with JavaScript's flexibility on top.

While the Rust Query Planner delivers a lot, it currently doesn't support a handfull of Hive Gateway
features. We're hard at work to achieve full compatibility soon! Check out the
[feature comparison](/docs/gateway/other-features/rust-query-planner#compared-to-javascript-query-planner)
for details.
