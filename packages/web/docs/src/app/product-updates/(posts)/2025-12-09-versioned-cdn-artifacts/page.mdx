You can now fetch CDN artifacts for a specific schema version, enabling historical schema retrieval
and more predictable deployments.

## Versioned Artifact Endpoints

New CDN endpoints allow fetching schema artifacts for a specific version:

```bash
# Fetch artifact for a specific version
curl -L -H 'X-Hive-CDN-Key: CDN_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  "https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/TARGET_ID/version/VERSION_ID/sdl"

# Fetch contract artifact for a specific version
curl -L -H 'X-Hive-CDN-Key: CDN_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  "https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/TARGET_ID/version/VERSION_ID/contracts/CONTRACT_NAME/supergraph"
```

All artifact types are supported: `sdl`, `services`, `supergraph`, and `metadata`.

Note: Versioned artifacts are only available for schemas published after December 11, 2025. Schemas
published before this date do not have versioned artifacts stored.

## Schema Version ID Header

CDN artifact responses now include the `x-hive-schema-version-id` header, providing the version ID
of the schema being served. This header is included in responses from both the latest and versioned
endpoints.

```bash copy=false filename="Example response headers"
x-hive-schema-version-id: abc123-def456-789
etag: "a1b2c3d4"
```

This enables you to:

- Track which schema version your gateways are running
- Correlate schema versions with deployments
- Fetch the exact same schema version later using the versioned endpoint
