Earlier this year, we introduced
[**Organization Access Tokens**](/product-updates/2025-03-10-new-access-tokens) to enhance security
and simplify access management across teams. These tokens brought several benefits:

- **Granular permission scopes:** Define precise permissions for tokens, limiting access to specific
  resources (e.g., projects, targets, services, or app deployments).
- **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure tokens have only the permissions they need—nothing more.
- **Replacement for registry access tokens:** Organization access tokens fully replace registry
  tokens used by the Hive CLI and usage reporting.
- **Foundation for the GraphQL Management API:** These tokens enable programmatic interaction with
  Hive Console, including creating and managing resources such as projects, targets, and subgraphs.

### Introducing Personal and Project Access Tokens

After collaborating with enterprises managing multiple GraphQL projects and teams, we recognized the
need for more flexibility around **who** can create and manage access tokens.

With this update, we’re introducing two new token types, **Personal Access Tokens** and **Project
Access Tokens**, to give teams finer control and autonomy while maintaining strong security
boundaries.

#### Project Access Tokens

- Scoped to a single project.
- Manageable by project members with the appropriate permissions.
- Ideal for **CI/CD pipelines** performing actions such as schema publish or schema check.
- Organization admins can view and revoke all project access tokens directly from organization
  settings.

#### Personal Access Tokens

- Scoped to individual organization members.
- Reflect a member’s role permissions - any role changes automatically update the token’s
  capabilities.
- Perfect for **local development and CLI operations** like `hive dev` or `hive check`.
- Can be enabled or disabled on a per-user basis, and revoked anytime by organization
  administrators.

### Conclusion

These new token types provide a balance between **security** and **developer autonomy**:

- Organizations maintain full visibility and control.
- Teams can independently manage tokens for their workflows.
- Tokens now align naturally with your existing permission model and resource hierarchy.

Together with organization access tokens, these additions complete a unified and flexible access
control system for Hive.
