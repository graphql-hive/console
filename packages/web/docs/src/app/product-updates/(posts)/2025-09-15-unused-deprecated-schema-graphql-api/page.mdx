You can now programmatically identify unused types and deprecated fields directly via the Hive
Console API.

This makes it easier to:

- Clean up your schema and remove dead weight
- Spot deprecated fields still in use
- Keep your GraphQL API lean, efficient, and future-proof

Perfect for teams who want to automate schema maintenance as part of their CI/CD workflows.
