Earlier this year, we introduced **customizable default member roles** for organizations using OIDC
authentication. This made it possible to automatically assign roles to users as they signed in via
OIDC.

With this update, we’re extending that functionality to give organizations **much finer control over
which resources new users receive access to**.

### Granular Default Resource Assignment for OIDC Users

Previously, newly signed-up OIDC users were granted the configured default role **across all
resources**. You can now specify **exactly which resources** (e.g., projects, targets, services)
should be assigned to new OIDC-authenticated users.

This makes onboarding more secure and prevents automatic access to resources users don’t need.

### Improved Member Invitations

It is now also possible to **invite members with predefined resources already assigned**. This
allows administrators to configure the correct access **before** the user joins, removing the need
for manual adjustments after their first sign-in.

### Conclusion

These improvements offer:

- More secure and controlled onboarding
- Less manual work for administrators
- More predictable access patterns for large teams and enterprises

Together, these changes make role and resource management more intuitive, flexible, and aligned with
real-world organizational structures.
