We're rolling out two updates today to help you manage how you (and your team) access Hive:
**Account Linking** and **Invitation-Only OIDC**.

### Account Linking

Previously, Hive treated every login method as a distinct identity. If you logged in with Google one
day and GitHub the next, even with the same email address, you ended up with two separate accounts.

Starting today, Hive will **automatically link login methods based on your email address**.

If you sign up with Google, and later sign in with GitHub using the same email address, you will
land in the same account. No more accidental duplicate profiles.

> **Note:** If you have already created multiple Hive accounts using the same email address across
> different login methods, automatic linking is not yet available. We are working on an account
> merging process to help you consolidate these accounts in the future.

### Invitation-Only OIDC

We have also added a new control layer to our OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration. Previously, any
user logging in via an OIDC provider was automatically added to the associated organization.

You can now enable the **Require Invitation to Join** option in your organization OIDC settings.
When enabled, users logging in via OIDC will **only be granted access to the organization if they
have received an explicit invitation beforehand**. This allows you to keep SSO active for your whole
company while restricting Hive access to specific team members.

### Summary

- **One Identity:** Use Google, GitHub, or SSO interchangeably without creating ghost accounts.
- **Stricter Access:** Prevent unintended joins in large organizations by enforcing invitations on
  top of SSO.

We hope these changes provide a more seamless and secure experience for managing your Hive accounts
and organizations.
