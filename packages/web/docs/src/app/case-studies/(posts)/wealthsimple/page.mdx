[Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca) is one of Canada's fastest growing financial
institutions and offers a full suite of simple, sophisticated financial products. As the company
scaled, the need for a robust, flexible, and efficient API architecture became paramount, leading to
the adoption of GraphQL with Hive as their central API management solution.

## Challenges

The primary challenges that led Wealthsimple to seek a GraphQL solution included:

1. **Service Integration Complexity**

- Managing a distributed architecture with many microservices
- Need for comprehensive usage analytics beyond basic performance monitoring
- Coordinating API changes across multiple development teams
- Ensuring consistent performance regardless of customer profile

2. **Development Workflow**

- Lack of visibility into API usage patterns
- Difficulty in tracking deprecated field usage
- No systematic way to validate schema changes
- Coordinating between multiple client applications (mobile and web)

## Architecture

### GraphQL Gateway

At the heart of the system lies a centralized GraphQL gateway that serves as the primary entry point
for all client applications. Built with TypeScript and Node.js, this gateway acts as an intelligent
router, orchestrating requests across the service landscape. The gateway implements
[schema stitching](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching) to unify microservice schemas into a
cohesive API surface.

### Service Layer

The underlying service layer comprises domain-specific services, representing different areas of
Wealthsimple's financial ecosystem. Most services are built in Ruby, with a small subset using other
technologies. These services use a mixed architecture approach, where some endpoints expose GraphQL
interfaces while others maintain REST APIs. To seamlessly integrate REST services, the gateway
utilizes Apollo data sources, ensuring consistent data access patterns. The team has also developed
specialized components, including a custom Spring bean for reporting usage metrics to GraphQL Hive.

  > Hive enables Wealthsimple to build flexible and resilient GraphQL APIs. The GitHub integration
  provides feedback in a format developers are familiar with and conditional breaking changes enable
  us to focus our discussion on schema design rather than maintenance. Hive empowers us to
  confidently evolve our schemas by ensuring seamless API updates, detecting potential breaking
  changes, and guiding developers.
</div>

## Implementation

The implementation focused on two key areas:

1. **Usage Analytics Integration**

- Implemented complementary tracking alongside existing Datadog setup
- Enhanced GraphQL usage monitoring capabilities:
  - Client-specific query tracking
  - Detailed operation body analysis
  - Real-time usage statistics

2. **Schema Validation System**

- Established global policy for schema changes
- Implemented 30-day field usage monitoring
- Integrated real-time developer feedback system
- Set up automated validation checks for breaking changes

## Results & Benefits

The implementation has delivered several significant benefits:

1. **Enhanced Development Workflow**

- Data-driven decision making for schema changes.
- Prevented potentially breaking changes through usage analysis.
- Improved developer confidence in schema modifications.

2. **Operational Improvements**

- Better visibility into API usage patterns.
- Reduced risk of breaking changes.
- More efficient schema management.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Validation Impact**

   Schema validation has helped Wealthsimple's API development process by enabling data-driven
   decisions based on actual usage patterns. This shift from guesswork to quantifiable insights has
   allowed teams to confidently evolve the API while maintaining stability for existing clients.

2. **Integration Considerations**

   Cross-platform integration has positioned Wealthsimple as an active contributor to the
   open-source community, where they now maintain the official
   [GraphQL Hive Ruby client](https://github.com/rperryng/graphql-ruby-hive?tab=readme-ov-file#graphql-hive-graphql-ruby-integration).
   This commitment to open-source development not only supports their own cross-platform needs but
   also benefits the broader GraphQL ecosystem. Their experience demonstrates the importance of both
   consuming and contributing to open-source tools while building a robust financial platform.

## Future Plans

1. **Schema Registry Migration**

   Wealthsimple plans to transition away from their existing git-ops system in favor of Hive's
   comprehensive schema registry feature. This strategic move will modernize their schema management
   process by providing a centralized, automated system for schema validation and distribution. This
   migration represents a key step in Wealthsimple's broader initiative to enhance their API
   infrastructure and developer experience.

2. **Security Infrastructure Enhancement**

   Wealthsimple is implementing
   [Hive's App Deployments feature](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/schema-registry/app-deployments)
   to optimize performance and track API usage against app versions. This solution will restrict API
   access to predefined queries only and implement a query hash system for network optimization.

3. **Gateway Evolution**

   Wealthsimple is improving its API gateway infrastructure by focusing on migrating from their
   current Apollo server with schema stitching to Hive Gateway. Having already tested
   [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) in staging with
   [promising performance gains](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/comparison#better-runtime-performance),
   the team is now working on adopting Hive Gateway to enable a gradual transition to
   [federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation). This approach will allow teams to
   maintain ownership of their schemas while enabling a methodical, type-by-type migration from the
   existing stitched schema setup to a federated architecture.

## Conclusion

Wealthsimple's implementation of GraphQL with Hive has proven to be a successful strategic decision,
providing enhanced visibility, improved development workflows, and a solid foundation for future
scaling. The company's positive experience with the platform has led to expanded usage plans and
continued investment in the GraphQL ecosystem. The gradual, thoughtful approach to migration and
feature adoption has enabled the team to maintain stability while advancing their technical
capabilities.
