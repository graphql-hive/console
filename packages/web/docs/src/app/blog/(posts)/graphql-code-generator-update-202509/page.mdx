  GraphQL Code Generator September 2025 update comes with improvements to Federation and normal
  GraphQL server typing and lots of internal quality-of-life changes.
---

GraphQL Code Generator just released a major update to improve type correctness and usability for
both Federation and standard GraphQL server architecture. This milestone, the result of a 9-month
long journey, closes many long-standing reported issues and serves as the foundation to help us move
forward faster.

## Migration Guide

- Federation entity's resolver types correctly reflect the parent may come from a different subgraph
  (via `__resolveReference`) or from the same subgraph. Use `mappers` to explicitly set the expected
  use case to help with typing. For example:

```ts
// If you are only resolving fields through `__resolveReference`, then explicitly set the reference type:
import { FederationReferenceTypes } from "./types.generated";
export type UserMapper = FederationReferenceTypes["User"]

// If your current subgraph returns a different interface to `__resolveReference`, include both in the mapper, and handle both cases in subsequent resolvers:
import { UserTypeFromDatabase } from "./your-database-type";
import { FederationReferenceTypes } from "./types.generated";
export type UserMapper =
  | UserTypeFromDatabase
  | FederationReferenceTypes["User"]

// If you want to standardise the mapper interface (which means you may need to resolve for `UserTypeFromDatabase` in `__resolveReference`):
import { UserTypeFromDatabase } from "./your-database-type";
export type UserMapper = UserTypeFromDatabase
```

- If you have implemented non-meta resolvers in Interfaces, remove them as they are never called.
  Generated types have been updated to reflect this.
- If you have implemented `__isTypeOf` resolvers for types that are not Interface implementing types
  or Union member types, remove them as they are never called. Generated types have been updated to
  reflect this.

## Breaking Changes

- `FederationReferenceTypes` is generated instead of inlining `__resolveReference` types to improve
  usability with mappers
- Fixed mappers for Federation use case
- Federation `__resolveReference` resolver is available for Interfaces
- Fixed Federation directives types such as `@external`, `@requires`, etc.
- Interface non-meta resolvers are no longer generated.
- `__isTypeOf` resolver is no longer generated for output types which are not Interface implementing
  types or Union member types
- `UnwrappedObject` type is no longer generated
- `Record<PropertyKey, never>` is generated instead of `{}` for empty object types
- Deprecated `generateInternalResolversIfNeeded` option. Codegen decides whether to generate meta
  resolvers to match the spec
- Deprecated `watchConfig`, `dedupeFragments` and `noGraphQLTag` legacy options
- Dropped Node 18 support
- Refactored internal type overrides that has been causing confusion and frustration to
  contributors. This impacts downstream plugins that extend base `typescript` and
  `typescript-resolvers` plugins.

## Other Changes

- Partial success writes successful generation to file
- Migrated from Jest to Vitest

## Summary

This major release strengthens type safety for both Federation and standard GraphQL servers,
simplifies configs, and improves contributor experience. Thanks to community feedback and
collaboration, GraphQL Code Generator is more reliable and easier to extend than ever.
