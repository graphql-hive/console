Today, we are very happy to announce that The Guild has acquired Grafbase.

This step is part of our long-term goal to build a stable, long-lasting home for critical GraphQL
infrastructure — tools and platforms that teams can depend on for many years, regardless of market
shifts or vendor changes. We’ve followed a similar approach in the past with the [Stellate
acquisition](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/blog/stellate-acquisition) and when we welcomed Inigo’s enterprise customers and engineering team into the Hive
Platform.

Grafbase has been at the forefront of GraphQL Federation, building a high performance Rust Router
and a powerful cloud platform behind it. We’re now open sourcing the entire stack. Bringing the best
GraphQL Federation Routers and platform under one roof makes Hive Platform a natural first choice
for teams using GraphQL today.

We always had a good relationship and great respect for the Grafbase team, led by Fredrik Björk. We
admired their engineering and valued their competition: open, honest, the kind that pushes both
teams to improve. It's a rare thing to find in a competitor, and I thank them for it.

We are happy to welcome Grafbase users to The Guild’s ecosystem:

We’ve already started the work of integrating Grafbase dashboard into Hive Console and Grafbase
Router into Hive Router. Grafbase users can safely continue using the Grafbase platform and Grafbase
Rust Router. We’ll keep them running till all users have successfully migrated to our integrated
platform, at their own pace.

We already added support for using Hive Console as the schema registry and analytics platform to
Grafbase Router (which now supports all of the GraphQL Routers in the ecosystem), to make the
transition as smooth as possible.

For most users the transition can be concluded in just two steps:

1. Migrate from Grafbase Dashboard to Hive Console
2. Migrate from Grafbase Router to Hive Router

While the latter step is considered to be the more complicated step, we will make sure that every
user has enough time and support to complete the migration.

The Hive Platform is the best GraphQL Federation Platform out there. For everything GraphQL, we have
you covered. Now and for many years to come.
