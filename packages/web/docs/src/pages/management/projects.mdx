# Project Management

A Hive **project** represents a GraphQL API project running a GraphQL schema, created under an
organization.

Within a Hive **project**, you can create **targets** (which are equivalent to runtime environments)
and manage different schemas across different contextual runtimes.

## Supported project types

Hive supports the following project types:

- **Single Schema**: a GraphQL project that has a single GraphQL schema developed as a standalone.
- **Schema Stitching**: a form of remote schema merging allowing developers to merge any GraphQL
  schema(s), under one or many gateways. You can use either direct
  [Schema Stitching](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching) or
  [GraphQL-Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) for this project type.
- **Apollo Federation**: a form of remote schema merging developed according to the
  [Federation specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/).

## Create a new project

To create a new project, click on **Create Project +** button from your organization's main page:

<NextImage alt="Create Project Form" src={projectImage} className="mt-10 max-w-lg drop-shadow-md" />

Choose a project type based on your project's stack, and then enter the project name.

<Callout>
  Please note that a **project** type cannot be changed once it is created. However, you can always
  create an unlimited number of projects under your organization.
</Callout>

## Manage existing project

### GitHub Repository

Once you have your [Hive organization integrated with GitHub](/management/organizations#github), you
can connect between a project and a GitHub repository.

From the project's **Settings** tab, you can use the **Git Repository** section to select a
repository to associate with your Hive projects.

Associating a repository with your project will allow you to:

- Publish **Check Suite** back to GitHub (when `--github` flag is enabled for your `schema:publish`
  and `schema:check` commands - [read more here](/features/ci-integration)).

<NextImage
  alt="GitHub Check Suite"
  src={githubIntegrationImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

- Have direct connection between a schema version and a Git commit in your repository in Hive
  dashboard.

<NextImage
  alt="Associated Git"
  src={projectGitLinkImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Once a project is associated with a repository, you can specify `--github` flag when running Hive
CLI commands, and get the results reported back to GitHub
([you can learn move about this feature here](/api-reference/cli#cli-and-github-integration)).

### Rename a project

You can easily change the name of your projects in Hive by adjusting the settings of your project.

To do this, go to the **Settings** tab of your project, and use the **Project Name** form to rename
your project.

<Callout type="warning">
  Changing the name of your project will also change the slug of your project URL, and will
  invalidate any existing links to your project.
</Callout>

### Delete a project

As the owner of an organization, you have the option to delete a project, including all targets,
settings and all data collected during your use of Hive.

To delete an project, go to the **Settings** tab of your project, and use the **Delete Project**
section.

<Callout type="warning">This action is not reversible!</Callout>

## Alerts and Notifications

Hive allows you to configure alerts and notifications for your projects. To get started with alerts
and notifications, go to the **Settings** tab of your project, and click on the **Alerts** tab.

To use alerts and notifications, you need to have at least one **Alert Channel** configured, and
then you need to create an **Alert** that will be triggered when a specific condition is met.

### Alert Channels

**Alert Channels** are a way to configure **how** you want to receive alerts and notifications from
Hive.

From the **Alerts** tab of your project, you can create and manage your **Alert Channels**.

At the moment, Hive supports the following transports to ship your alerts and notifications:

#### Slack

Integrating your project with a Slack channel will allow you to receive alerts and notifications
shipped directly to a Slack channel.

<NextImage
  alt="Hive Slack Message"
  src={slackIntegrationImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

To integrate your **project** with a Slack channel, you first need to
[activate the Slack integration at the organization level](/management/organizations#slack).

Once you have activated the Slack integration, you can configure a Slack channel to connect to your
Hive project:

<NextImage
  alt="Hive and Slack Configuration"
  src={slackAlertFormImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-sm drop-shadow-md"
/>

#### HTTP Webhook

You can implement a custom HTTP webhook to receive alerts and notifications from Hive, when an alert
or a notification is triggered.

All you need to do is to provide a valid HTTP URL, and Hive will dispatch a `POST` request to that
URL, with a JSON payload as body (with `Content-Type: application/json` header set) when an alert or
a notification is triggered.

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that using this form of alert is intended to imlement custom flows. You cannot use an
  Incoming Webhook feature of products like MSTeams or Slack, because the expected payload is
  different.
</Callout>

<NextImage
  alt="HTTP Alert Configuration"
  src={projectHttpAlertImage}
  className="mt-6 max-w-sm drop-shadow-md"
/>

<Callout type="info">
  Every type of event/notification have a different JSON payload, please refer to the information
  below, for a specific payload structure for every kind of alert.
</Callout>

### Alerts and Notifications

**Alerts** are a way to configure **when** you want to receive alerts and notifications from Hive.

From the **Alerts** tab of your project, you can create and manage your **Active Alerts and
Notifications**.

To create a new kind of alert, use the **Create Alert** button and choose the **Alert type**,
**Alert Channel** and the target's name.

At the moment, Hive supports the following types of alerts and notifications (if you need a
different kind of alert, you can collaborate with us on
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/issues/253)):

#### Schema Changed Notification

An alert triggered when a fully valid and composable schema is published to a target.

This notification has the following payload when shipped over the **HTTP webhook** channel:

```ts copy=false
type SchemaChangedNotificationPayload = {
  /** General information about organization triggered the event */
  organization: {
    id: string
    cleanId: string
    name: string
  }
  /** General information about project triggered the event */
  project: {
    id: string
    cleanId: string
    name: string
  }
  /** General information about target triggered the event */
  target: {
    id: string
    cleanId: string
    name: string
  }
  /** Information about the published schema and the commit identification */
  schema: {
    id: string
    commit: string
    valid: boolean
  }
  /** List of changes and their criticality */
  changes: Array<{
    criticality: 'Breaking' | 'Dangerous' | 'Safe'
    message: string
    path?: string
  }>
  /** Useful information about the schema publication flow */
  messages: string[]
  /** List of validation and composition error */
  errors: Array<{
    message: string
    path?: string
  }>
  /** A boolean indicator set to true, when this is the first schema published to the target */
  initial: boolean
}
```
