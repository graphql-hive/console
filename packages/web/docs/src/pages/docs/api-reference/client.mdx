# Hive Client

**Hive Client** is a set of libraries and utilities for interacting with Hive, for both
[Schema Registry](/docs/features/schema-registry) and
[Usage Reporting](/docs/features/usage-reporting).

## Available Clients

### JavaScript / NodeJS Client

[`@graphql-hive/client`](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/client) is the official library for
interacting with Hive's **Schema Registry** and **Usage Reporting**.

You can refer to the following guides for integration with your project:

#### Configuration

Refer to the
[`HivePluginOptions` interface](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/packages/libraries/client/src/internal/types.ts#LL40C29-L40C29)
for complete list of options and configurations you can pass to the Hive JavaScript Client.

#### Client Information

You can pass a custom `clientInfo` callback to the `HivePluginOptions` to have full control on how
you detect a client's information.

```ts
const config: HivePluginOptions = {
  usage: {
    clientInfo(context) {
      const name = context.headers['x-graphql-client-name']
      const version = context.headers['x-graphql-client-version']

      if (name && version) {
        return { name, version }
      }

      return null
    }
  }
}
```

#### Excluding Operations

You can pass a custom `exclude` array to the `HivePluginOptions` to ignore specific operations from
being reported to Hive.

```ts
const config: HivePluginOptions = {
  usage: {
    exclude: ['unwantedOperationName', 'anotherOperationName']
  }
}
```

#### Sampling

You can pass a custom `sampleRate` array to the `HivePluginOptions` to sample a percentage of the
total operations reported. By default, Hive agent reports 100% of the operations (`1.0`).

```ts
const config: HivePluginOptions = {
  usage: {
    sampleRate: 0.1
  }
}
```

#### Custom Integration

If your GraphQL server is not listed above, you maybe implement a custom integration. Start by
importing and creating a Hive instance using the `createHive` function.

```ts
import { createHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const hive = createHive({
  enabled: true,
  debug: true, // or, false
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
  reporting: {
    // feel free to set dummy values here, or use actual
    // environment information that you have
    author: 'Author of the schema version',
    commit: 'git sha or any identifier'
  }
})
```

Then, you can use the `reportSchema` to publish your runtime schema to Hive:

```ts
// Once you server starts and the GraphQL schema becomes
// available, call "reportSchema" with your schema
hive.reportSchema({ schema: yourSchema })
```

You can also implement a custom implementation for the Usage Reporting feature, and send usage
reports to Hive.

Call `collectUsage` as soon as a GraphQL operation execution starts, and use the return value
callback when the operation ends. You may also wrap and replace the `execute` function with the
following:

```ts
export async function executeWithHive(args: ExecutionArgs): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
  // args is ExecutionArgs of graphql-js
  const finish = hive.collectUsage(args)
  // result is ExecutionResult of graphql-js
  const result = await execute(args)
  // Use this callback to finish measuring times, and save the operation report
  finish(result)

  return result
}
```

### Ruby Client

The [`graphql-hive` gem](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-ruby-hive) allows
[GraphQL-Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/) users to use Hive to both usage reporting and publish
schemas to the registry.

Refer to the following guides for integration with your project:

### PHP Client

The [Lighthouse Hive](https://github.com/stayallive/lighthouse-graphql-hive) is third-party
integration can be used to measure and collect data against all your GraphQL operations.
