# Hive Client

**Hive Client** is a set of libraries and utilities for interacting with Hive, for both
[Schema Registry](/docs/features/schema-registry) and
[Usage Reporting](/docs/features/usage-reporting).

## Available Clients

### JavaScript / NodeJS Client

[`@graphql-hive/client`](https://npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/client) is the official library for
interacting with Hive's **Schema Registry** and **Usage Reporting**.

You can refer to the following guides for getting started within your project, then revisit this
page for configuring the client to your needs.

#### Configuration

Refer to the
[`HivePluginOptions` interface](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/packages/libraries/client/src/internal/types.ts#LL40C29-L40C29)
for complete list of options and configurations you can pass to the Hive JavaScript Client.

#### Client Information

By default, the client information is retrieved by looking up the `x-client-name` and
`x-client-version` headers in the HTTP request. For operations executed via the
`GraphQL over WebSocket` protocol, the client information is retrieved by looking for the `client`
key within the `connectionParams`.

You can fully customize how to retrieve the client information by passing a custom `clientInfo`
implementation.

You can pass a custom `clientInfo` callback to the `HivePluginOptions` to have full control on how
you detect a client's information.

```ts
const config: HivePluginOptions = {
  usage: {
    clientInfo(context) {
      const name = context?.headers?.['x-graphql-client-name']
      const version = context?.headers?.['x-graphql-client-version']

      if (name && version && typeof name === 'string' && typeof version === 'string') {
        return { name, version }
      }

      return null
    }
  }
}
```

The context object is the context object as used within the GraphQL execution. Depending on your
server framework and GraphQL protocol, the context object may contain different properties.

We recommend to always try to safely decode the context.

#### Excluding Operations

You can pass a custom `exclude` array to the `HivePluginOptions` to ignore specific operations from
being reported to Hive.

```ts
const config: HivePluginOptions = {
  usage: {
    exclude: ['unwantedOperationName', 'anotherOperationName']
  }
}
```

#### Sampling

##### Basic sampling

With `sampleRate` option, you're able to control the sampling rate of the usage reporting. Setting
it to `0.5` will result in 50% of the operations being sent to Hive. There is no guarantee that
every operation will be reported at least once (see `atLeastOnceSampler`).

Default: `1` (100%)

```typescript
useHive({
  /* ... other options ... */,
  usage: {
    sampleRate: 0.6 // 60% of the operations will be sent to Hive
  }
})
```

##### Dynamic sampling

GraphQL Hive client accepts a function that returns a number between 0 and 1. This allows you to
implement dynamic sampling based on the operation's context.

If `sampler` is defined, `sampleRate` is ignored.

A sample rate between 0 and 1.

- `0.0` = 0% chance of being sent
- `1.0` = 100% chance of being sent.
- `true` = 100%
- `false` = 0%

```typescript
useHive({
  /* ... other options ... */,
  usage: {
  sampler(samplingContext) {
      if (samplingContext.operationName === 'GetUser') {
        return 0.5 // 50% of GetUser operations will be sent to Hive
      }

      return 0.7; // 70% of the other operations will be sent to Hive
    }
  }
})
```

##### At-least-once sampling

If you want to make sure that every operation is reported at least once, you can use the
`atLeastOnceSampler`. Every operation is reported at least once, but every next occurrence is
decided by the sampler.

```typescript
import { useHive, atLeastOnceSampler} from '@graphql-hive/client';

useHive({
  /* ... other options ... */,
  usage: {
    sampler: atLeastOnceSampler({
      // Produces a unique key for a given GraphQL request.
      // This key is used to determine the uniqueness of a GraphQL operation.
      keyFn(samplingContext) {
        // Operation name is a good candidate for a key, but not perfect,
        // as not all operations have names
        // and some operations may have the same name but different body.
        return samplingContext.operationName;
      },
      sampler(_samplingContext) {
        const hour = new Date().getHours();

        if (hour >= 9 && hour <= 17) {
          return 0.3;
        }

        return 0.8;
      }
    })
  }
})
```

#### Custom Integration

If your GraphQL server is not listed above, you can implement a custom integration. Start by
importing and creating a Hive instance using the `createHive` function.

```ts
import { createHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const hive = createHive({
  enabled: true,
  debug: true, // or, false
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN'
})
```

Call `collectUsage` as soon as a GraphQL operation execution starts, and use the return value
callback when the operation ends. You may also wrap and replace the `execute` function with the
following:

```ts
export async function executeWithHive(args: ExecutionArgs): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
  // args is ExecutionArgs of graphql-js
  const finish = hive.collectUsage(args)
  // result is ExecutionResult of graphql-js
  const result = await execute(args)
  // Use this callback to finish measuring times, and save the operation report
  finish(result)

  return result
}
```

### Ruby Client

The [`graphql-hive` gem](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-ruby-hive) allows
[GraphQL-Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/) users to use Hive for usage reporting.

Refer to the following guides for integration with your project:

### PHP Client

The [Lighthouse Hive](https://github.com/stayallive/lighthouse-graphql-hive) is third-party
integration can be used to measure and collect data against all your GraphQL operations.
