# Hive CLI (Command Line Interface)

You can perform [schema-registry actions](/docs/features/schema-registry#actions-on-schemas) on your
Hive targets schemas using the Hive CLI.

## Installation

### NodeJS

If you are running a JavaScript/NodeJS project, you can install Hive CLI from the `npm` registry:

<PackageCmd packages={['-D @graphql-hive/cli']} />

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive CLI as part of your project, under `devDependencies`, instead of
  using a global installation.
</Callout>

### Binary

If you are running a non-JavaScript project, you can download the prebuilt binary of Hive CLI using
the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Usage

### Publish a schema

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”‘">
  This CLI command requires an active registry token with **Read & Write** permissions to the
  target.
</Callout>

Start by setting your Hive token in [`hive.json`](/docs/api-reference/cli#config-file-hivejson)
file, or set it as `HIVE_TOKEN` environment variable.

- [Publishing a schema to the Schema Registry](/docs/features/schema-registry#publish-a-schema)

#### Single Schema Project

If you have a single file for your GraphQL schema:

```bash
hive schema:publish schema.graphql
```

Or, multiple files using a `glob` expression:

```bash
hive schema:publish "src/*.graphql"
```

Further reading:

- [`schema:publish` API Reference](/docs/api-reference/cli#hive-schemapublish-file)

#### Apollo Federation / Schema-Stitching projects

```bash
hive schema:publish --service reviews --url http://my-service.com/graphql schema.graphql
```

- [Apollo Router integration](/docs/integrations/apollo-router)
- [Apollo-Server integration](/docs/integrations/apollo-server)

#### Hive Metadata

If your GraphQL schema runtime requires any metadata to run, you can attach metadata to your schema
publication. Hive metadata published to Hive must be a valid JSON, and limited to `25MB`.

To attach metadata to your published schema, you can use `--metadata` flag when publishing.

You can load the metadata from a file:

```bash
hive schema:publish schema.graphql --metadata metadata.json
```

Or, use an inline JSON passed as a string:

```bash
hive schema:publish schema.graphql --metadata '{ "someData": true }'
```

### Check a schema

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”‘">
  This CLI command requires an active registry token with **Read** permissions to the target.
</Callout>

Start by setting your Hive token in [`hive.json`](/docs/api-reference/cli#config-file-hivejson)
file, or set it as `HIVE_TOKEN` environment variable.

Checking a GraphQL schema is the form of checking the compatbility of an upcoming schema, compared
to the latest published version.

This process of checking a schema needs to be done before **publishing** a new schema version. This
is usually done as part of a CI/CD pipeline, and as part of Pull Request flow.

Hive CLI will give you a list of all changes, sorted by criticality level (Breaking, Dangerous,
Safe) and fail the check once breaking change is detected.

```bash
hive schema:check schema.graphql
```

Or, multiple files using a `glob` expression:

```bash
hive schema:check "src/*.graphql"
```

Further reading:

- [`schema:check` API Reference](/docs/api-reference/cli#check-a-schema)
- [Publishing a schema to the Schema Registry](/docs/features/schema-registry#publish-a-schema)
- [Conditional Breaking Changes](/docs/management/targets#conditional-breaking-changes)

### Delete a schema

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”‘">
  This CLI command requires an active registry token with **Read & Write** permissions to the target
  and the project.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  This action is only available for Schema-Stitching and Apollo Federation projects.
</Callout>

Start by setting your Hive token in [`hive.json`](/docs/api-reference/cli#config-file-hivejson)
file, or set it as `HIVE_TOKEN` environment variable.

In case you want to delete a schema (or a subgraph in case of Federation), you can do so by using
the `hive schema:delete` command.

```bash
hive schema:delete SERVICE_NAME
```

<Callout>

You can also use `--dryRun` flag first to see what effect the command will have on the registry.

In case you want to confirm deletion of the service without typing anything in the terminal, use
`--confirm` flag.

</Callout>

### Git Metadata

If you are running `hive` command line in a directory that has a Git repository configured (`.git`),
then Hive will be able to automatically detect and extract the values for `--author` and `--commit`,
in order to tag schemas published using the `schema:publish` command.

You may override these values by passing the `--author` and `--commit` flags to the CLI.

If your project does not have a Git repository configured with a user name and email, you are
required to pass the `--author` and `--commit` flags to the CLI.

<Callout type="info">

If you need to change the way Git identifies your `author` property, you may use the following
commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@doe.org"
```

</Callout>

### Fetch a schema from CDN

You can fetch the GraphQL schema from the CDN using the `artifact:fetch` command.

<Callout type="info">
  You can learn how to create a CDN access token in the [High-Availability CDN
  documentation](/features/high-availability-cdn).
</Callout>

```bash
hive artifact:fetch --artifact sdl --cdn.endpoint VALUE --cdn.accessToken VALUE
```

For more information please refer to the
[CLI readme](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/packages/libraries/cli/README.md#commands).

### CLI and GitHub Integration

If [GitHub Integration](/docs/management/organizations#github) is enabled for your organization, and
a [GitHub repository is linked to the Hive project](/docs/management/projects#github-repository) is
active, you may specify an additional `--github` flag to report the results back to GitHub as Check
Suite (for `schema:check` and `schema:publish` commands):

```bash
hive schema:publish schema.graphql --github
```

```bash
hive schema:check schema.graphql --github
```
