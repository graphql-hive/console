# Hive Gateway

Hive Gateway is a fully open-source MIT-licensed GraphQL gateway that can act as a Apollo Federation
Gateway or a Proxy Gateway for any GraphQL services.

The Hive Gateway can be run as a standalone binary, a Docker Image, or as a JavaScript package (e.g.
within Node.js, Bun, Deno, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions or Cloudflare Workers)

Hive Gateway provides the following features on top of your Federated GraphQL schema or proxied
GraphQL schema:

- [GraphQL Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/features/subscriptions) with WebSockets, HTTP Callbacks or
  SSE
- Automatic query and request batching to reduce the number of HTTP requests to your subgraph
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](/docs/gateway/features/auth/jwt) authentication between client and gateway
  also between gateway and subgraph
- [Authorization](/docs/gateway/features/auth/generic-auth) on specific fields and types using
  Federation Auth directives like `@authenticated` and `@skipAuth`
- [Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/gateway/features/auth/generic-auth) either
  programmatically or with directives `@requiresScope` and `@policy`
- [Response Caching](/docs/gateway/features/performance/response-caching) based on either in memory
  or Redis for distributed caching optionally with `@cacheControl` directive
- [Security](/docs/gateway/features/security) features such as safelisting, depth limit etc
- [Rate Limiting](/docs/gateway/features/security/rate-limiting) on specific fields and types either
  programmatically or declaratively with `@rateLimit` directive
- [Prometheus and OpenTelemetry integration](/docs/gateway/features/monitoring-tracing) with fully
  customizable spans and attributes
- [Persisted Documents](/docs/gateway/features/performance/persisted-operations) backed by either
  Hive Registry or a selfhosting storage
- [E2E HTTP Compression](/docs/gateway/features/performance/compression) from the client to the
  subgraph for better performance and resource management
- [And more](/docs/gateway/features)
