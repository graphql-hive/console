# Hive Gateway

Hive Gateway is a fully open-source MIT-licensed GraphQL gateway for any JavaScript environment and
runtime such as Node.js, Bun, Deno, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers, and
more.

Hive Gateway is built on top of our existing libraries such as GraphQL Yoga, Envelop and so on, and
it combines all of their functionalities such as
[monitoring/tracing](/docs/gateway/features/monitoring-tracing),
[caching](/docs/gateway/features/performance),
[rate limiting](/docs/gateway/features/security/rate-limiting),
[security layers](/docs/gateway/features/security) as a standalone tool.

Hive Gateway provides all of its features for free without any extra paid license;

- GraphQL [Subscriptions](/docs/gateway/features/subscriptions) with WebSockets, HTTP Callbacks or
  SSE
- Automatic query and request batching to reduce the number of HTTP requests to your subgraph
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](/docs/gateway/features/auth/jwt) authentication between client and gateway
  also between gateway and subgraph
- [Authorization](/docs/gateway/features/auth/generic-auth) on specific fields and types using
  Federation Auth directives like `@authenticated` and `@skipAuth`
- [Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/gateway/features/auth/generic-auth) either
  programmatically or with directives `@requiresScope` and `@policy`
- [Response Caching](/docs/gateway/features/performance/response-caching) based on either in memory
  or Redis for distributed caching optionally with `@cacheControl` directive
- [Security](/docs/gateway/features/security) features such as safelisting, depth limit etc
- [Rate Limiting](/docs/gateway/features/security/rate-limiting) on specific fields and types either
  programmatically or declaratively with `@rateLimit` directive
- [Prometheus and OpenTelemetry integration](/docs/gateway/features/monitoring-tracing) with fully
  customizable spans and attributes
- [Persisted Documents](/docs/gateway/features/performance/persisted-operations) backed by either
  Hive Registry or a selfhosting storage
- [E2E HTTP Compression](/docs/gateway/features/performance/compression) from the client to the
  subgraph for better performance and resource management
- [And more](/docs/gateway/features)...
