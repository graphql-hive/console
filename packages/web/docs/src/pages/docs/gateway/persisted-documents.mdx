# Persisted Documents

Persisted documents can be used on your GraphQL server or Gateway to reduce the payload size of your
GraphQL requests and secure your GraphQL API by only allowing operations that are known and trusted
by your Gateway.

Hive Gateway can use the Hive Schema Registry as a source for persisted documents.

Learn more about setting up app deployments and persisted documents on the Hive Dashboard
[here](/docs/features/app-deployments).

### Configuration

After getting `endpoint` and `token` from Hive Registry, you can enable persisted documents in Hive
Gateway.

```sh filename="Run the Hive Gateway CLI"
npx hive-gateway supergraph "<cdn_endpoint>" \
  --hive-persisted-documents-token "<cdn_access_token>" \
  < endpoint > --hive-persisted-documents-endpoint
```

Instead of using the CLI you can also provide the same configuration via the `gateway.config.ts`
file.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  persistedDocuments: {
    type: 'hive',
    endpoint: '<cdn_endpoint>',
    token: '<cdn-access-token>'
  }
})
```

#### Enabling Arbitrary Documents

After enabling persisted documents on your Hive Gateway, any arbitary GraphQL documents that don't
contain a `documentId` will be rejected. If you still want to allow executing arbitrary documents,
you can set `allowArbitraryDocuments` to `true` in the configuration.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts" {8}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  persistedDocuments: {
    type: 'hive',
    endpoint: '<cdn_endpoint>',
    token: '<cdn-access-token>',
    allowArbitraryDocuments: true
  }
})
```
