# Serverless / On the Edge

Hive Gateway can be deployed on the edge. This means that you can deploy your Hive Gateway to a
serverless environment like AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, or Azure Functions.

For Serverless environments, you cannot use Gateway CLI `hive-gateway` but you can use the
`createGatewayRuntime` function from `@graphql-hive/gateway` package.

The gateway configuration goes into `createGatewayRuntime` function instead of `gatewayConfig`
export in `gateway.config.ts` file.

## Distributed Caching

But you need to be aware of the limitations of these environments. For example, in-memory caching is
not possible in these environments. So you have to setup a distributed cache like Redis or
Memcached.

[See here to configure cache storage](/docs/gateway/other-features/performance).

## Bundling problem

Hive Gateway cannot import the required dependencies manually, and load the supergraph from the file
system. So if you are not using a schema registry such as Hive Gateway or Apollo GraphOS, we need to
save the supergraph as a code file (`supergraph.js` or `supergraph.ts`) and import it.

### Loading the subgraph transport

Gateway Transports are the key component of the gateway runtimeâ€™s execution. It allows the gateway
to communicate with the subgraph.

For example @graphql-mesh/transport-rest is used to communicate with the REST subgraphs generated by
OpenAPI and JSON Schema source handlers. And GraphQL subgraphs use GraphQL HTTP
Transport(@graphql-mesh/transport-http).

To avoid loading unnecessary transports and allow to provide your own transport, Hive Gateway is
loading those modules dynamically. This means that the bundler can't know statically that the
transport packages should be included in the bundle.

When running in a bundled environment like Serevless and Edge, you need to statically configure the
transports needed to comunicate with your upstream services. This way, the transport modules are
statically referenced and will be included into the bundle.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import http from '@graphql-mesh/transport-http'
import supergraph from './supergraph'

const gatewayRuntime = createGatewayRuntime({
  supergraph,
  transports: {
    // Add here every transports used by subgraphs

    http // For example, the `http` transport for GraphQL based subgraphs.
  }
})

export default { fetch: gatewayRuntime }
```

### Loading the supergraph from a file

For example, in GraphQL Mesh you need to save the supergraph as a TypeScript file:

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export const composeConfig = defineConfig({
  output: 'supergraph.ts',
  subgraph: [
    //...
  ]
})
```

In `supergraph.ts` file, you need to export the supergraph:

```ts
export default /* GraphQL */ `
  #...
`
```

Then you need to import the supergraph in your serverless function:

```ts
import { createGatewayRuntime, WSTransport } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
// Let's say you are using WS transport
import supergraph from './supergraph.js'

const serveRuntime = createGatewayRuntime({
  supergraph,
  transports: {
    ws: WSTransport
  }
})
```
