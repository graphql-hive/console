# Resources

Finding and defining the right amount of resources for your GraphQL gateway is important to ensure
ongoing performance and reliability. This guide will help you understand how to define the resources
for your gateway.

## CPU and Memory

The two main resources you need to define for your gateway are CPU and memory. These resources are
used to ensure that your gateway has enough resources to run efficiently.

For most applications, you can with the following default values:

- **CPU: 1**
- **Memory: 1GB**

These values are a good starting point for most applications. However, you may need to adjust these
values based on your application's requirements. For example, if your application has a high volume
of traffic, you may need to increase the CPU and memory resources.

For production environments with high-traffic, we recommend using the following values:

- **CPU: 2**
- **Memory: 2-4GB**

## Environment Variables

We recommend setting `NODE_ENV` to `production` to ensure that your gateway runs in production mode.
This will also enable parallelism optimizations that can improve performance.

By default, the gateway will available parallelism for the amount of workers to spawn. You can set
the `FORK` environment variable to the number of workers you want to spawn. For example, to spawn 12
workers, you can set `FORK=12`.
