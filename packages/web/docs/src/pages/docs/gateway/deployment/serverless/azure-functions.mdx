# Deploying Hive Gateway to Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless environment that supports JavaScript. Hive Gateway is platform
agnostic and can be deployed to Azure Functions as well.

  Before you start, make sure you read the [Serverless / On the
  Edge](/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless) page.

```ts
import { app } from '@azure/functions'
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

const handler = createGatewayRuntime(/* Your configuration */)

app.http('graphql', {
  method: ['GET', 'POST'],
  handler
})
```
