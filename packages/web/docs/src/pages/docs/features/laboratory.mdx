# Laboratory

Under your target page, you'll find the **Laboratory** page. The Laboratory allows you to explore
your GraphQL schema and run queries against a mocked version of your GraphQL service.

## Explore your GraphQL schema

You can use the full power of [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) directly within Hive:
compose your GraphQL operations, explore with different field and variations, and access your
GraphQL schema full documentation.

## Link a Laboratory Endpoint

You can link your actual GraphQL API endpoint to the Laboratory, so you can query for the actual
data.

You can set the GraphQL endpoint URL within the target settings.

Afterwards you can execute queries against your actual GraphQL API. Please make sure to set the
according CORS headers on your server for allowing the Laboratory to access your API from within the
browser.
