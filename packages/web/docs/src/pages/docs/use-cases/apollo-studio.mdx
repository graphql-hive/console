# Open Source Apollo Studio Alternative

GraphQL Hive stands as a **compelling alternative to Apollo Studio** (Apollo GraphOS). With a
various of features and benefits, GraphQL Hive has proven itself as an exceptional choice for both
individual developers and teams seeking a powerful GraphQL development environment.

## Seamless Integration with Apollo Ecosystem

One of GraphQL Hive's standout features is its **seamless integration with the Apollo ecosystem**.
It harmoniously works alongside the [Apollo Router](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-router) and
[Apollo Gateway](/docs/other-integrations/apollo-gateway), ensuring a consistent and smooth
experience for users. This integration extends to supporting
[Apollo Federation v1 and v2](/docs/get-started/apollo-federation), allowing you to leverage the
advantages of federated architectures while benefiting from GraphQL Hive's capabilities.

## Familiar Interface and Transition

For those fimiliar with using Rover CLI, transitioning to GraphQL Hive is remarkably
straightforward. The [Hive CLI](/docs/api-reference/cli) has a **similar interface, minimizing the
learning curve for existing users**. This aspect simplifies the migration process from Apollo Studio
to GraphQL Hive, allowing developers to quickly adapt and continue their work without interruption.

## Open Source Freedom, No Vendor Lock-in

Built on a foundation of open source technologies like
[Postgres, ClickHouse, and Redis](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.community.yml),
**GraphQL Hive champions the open source ethos**. Entirely MIT licensed, it offers unparalleled
freedom to its users, enabling them to customize and extend the platform as needed. This commitment
to openness also helps developers avoid vendor lock-in, granting them full control over their
GraphQL infrastructure.

GraphQL Hive does not gate any features behind a paywall. Self-hosted and cloud-hosted options are
identical.

## On-Premise and Cloud Hosting Options

Whether you're working on a side project or managing a larger beast, GraphQL Hive caters to your
hosting needs. The [self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting/get-started) option is entirely free,
eliminating any limitations on usage. Furthermore,
[GraphQL Hive Cloud](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) offers a free Hobby plan, perfectly suited
for most side projects. For those seeking more advanced features and capabilities, the Pro plan
comes with a 30-day free trial, ensuring you find the best fit for your requirements.
