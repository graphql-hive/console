# Envelop

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-hive/client']} />

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive Client package as a direct dependency of your project, because it
  includes a runtime to send usage reports and schemas to Hive registry.
</Callout>

The `@graphql-hive/client` package exports an
[Envelop plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/envelop), that can be used directly with any server
that supports Envelop.

## Integration Guide

### Publishing Schemas

Please use the [Hive CLI to publish your GraphQL schema](../api-reference/cli.mdx#publish-a-schema).
Follow the [CI/CD instructions](./ci-cd.mdx) for automating the process.

### Usage Reporting

You can send usage reporting to Hive registry by using the `usage` section of the configuration:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema'

const plugin = useHive({
  enabled: true, // Enable/Disable Hive Client
  token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
  reporting: { ... },
  usage: true
})
```
