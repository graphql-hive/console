# Apollo-Server

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-hive/client']} />

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive Client package as a direct dependency of your project, because it
  includes a runtime to send usage reports and schemas to Hive registry.
</Callout>

The `@graphql-hive/client` package exports a
[Apollo-Server plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), that can be used
directly.

## Integration Guide

### Publishing Schemas

Please use the [Hive CLI to publish your GraphQL schema](../api-reference/cli.mdx#publish-a-schema).
Follow the [CI/CD instructions](./ci-cd.mdx) for automating the process.

### Usage Reporting

You can send usage reporting to Hive registry by using the `usage` section of the configuration:

```ts
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
import { hiveApollo } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  plugins: [
    hiveApollo({
      enabled: true,
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      reporting: { ... },
      usage: true,  // add this one
    })
  ]
})
```
