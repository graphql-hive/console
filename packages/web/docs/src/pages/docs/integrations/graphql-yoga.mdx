# GraphQL-Yoga

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-hive/client
```

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive Client package as a direct dependency of your project, because it
  includes a runtime to send usage reports and schemas to Hive registry.
</Callout>

The `@graphql-hive/client` package exports an
[Envelop plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/envelop), that can be used directly with
[GraphQL-Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server).

## Integration Guide

### Publishing Schemas

Please use the [Hive CLI to publish your GraphQL schema](../api-reference/cli.mdx#publish-a-schema).
Follow the [CI/CD instructions](./ci-cd.mdx) for automating the process.

### Usage Reporting

<Callout>
  For more configuration options, such as sampling, client name and version reporting, please refer
  to the [Hive client configuration](/docs/api-reference/client#configuration) reference.
</Callout>

You can send usage reporting to Hive registry by using the `usage` section of the configuration:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useYogaHive } from '@graphql-hive/client'
import { schema } from './schema'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    useYogaHive({
      enabled: true, // Enable/Disable Hive Client
      token: 'YOUR-TOKEN',
      // Collects and send usage reporting based on executed operations
      usage: true
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
