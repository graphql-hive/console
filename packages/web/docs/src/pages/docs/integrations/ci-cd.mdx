# CI/CD and Hive CLI

This guide is a collection of features and capabilities you can configure with Hive, to integrate it
with Continuous Integration (CI) Continuous Deployment (CD) setups.

## Overview

The [Hive CLI](/docs/api-reference/cli) can be installed on any environment, including CI/CD
environments.

If you are using a JavaScript/NodeJS project, you should install the
[Hive CLI](/docs/api-reference/cli#nodejs) under `devDependencies` of your project, and use it
directly with your preferred package manager (for example: `yarn hive ...` or `pnpm hive ...`).

If you are using a different runtime environment for your project, you should install the
[Hive CLI binary](/docs/api-reference/cli#binary) and use it directly as a binary (`hive ...`).

### GitHub Check Suites

If you are using GitHub Actions, you can specify an additional flag to the Hive CLI: `--github`.

If [GitHub Integration](/docs/management/organizations#github) is enabled for your organization, and
a [GitHub repository is linked to the Hive project](/docs/management/projects#github-repository) is
active, you may specify an additional `--github` flag to report the results back to GitHub as Check
Suite (for `schema:check` and `schema:publish` commands):

```bash
hive schema:publish schema.graphql --github
```

```bash
hive schema:check schema.graphql --github
```

## Best Practices

We recommend using 2 different models schema publication to Hive:

1. For your actual runtime (`staging` and `production` targets), we recommend using a
   [Hive Client](/docs/api-reference/client) library that runs along with your GraphQL gateway, and
   publishes the GraphQL schema, along with [Usage Reporting](/docs/features/usage-reporting)
   feature enabled.
2. For your development process (`development` target), we recommend using CI pipelines to publish
   the schema to Hive using [Hive CLI](/docs/api-reference/cli):

   - Your `main` / `master` branch should use `schema:publish` command to set the schema, once a
     change has been made and approved.
   - Your Pull Request CI pipeline should use `schema:check` command to validate the schema and
     compare it against the latest valid schema of the target.
   - The `development` target may also use the
     [Cross-target checks for Conditional Breaking Changes](/docs/management/targets#cross-target-checks)
     and use real-time traffic from `staging` / `production` environment to determine if a change is
     breaking or not.

Implementing the above will allow you to:

- Have full control of your schema changes, and be able to identify and manage changes made to your
  GraphQL schema through Pull Requests.
- Have a complete overview of your GraphQL schema evolution
- Have a clear distinction between your development and production environments, and be able to
  manage them separately.
- Combine the observability from your `production` environment, into the development process, to
  identify breaking changes before they are merged into `main` / `master` branch.
