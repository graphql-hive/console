# Deleting a schema

In case you want to delete a schema (or a subgraph in case of Federation), you can do so by using
the `hive schema:delete` command.

## Requirements

- An active [token](./tokens) with "Read & Write" permissions to the Registry.
- Available only for Stitching and Federation projects

### NPM

Install [`@graphql-hive/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-hive/cli) package from NPM:

<PackageCmd packages={['-D @graphql-hive/cli']} />

### Linux / MacOS

Install latest version:

```bash
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | sh
```

Now, create a config file as `hive.json` and paste there your token:

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR-TOKEN"
}
```

<Callout>
  Having a config file is not mandatory, you can use `--token YOUR-TOKEN` or an environment variable
  called `HIVE_TOKEN` instead.
</Callout>

To delete a schema, use `hive schema:delete` command:

```bash
hive schema:delete <service-name>
```

<Callout>

You can also use `--dryRun` flag first to see what effect the command will have on the registry.

In case you want to confirm deletion of the service without typing anything in the terminal, use
`--confirm` flag.

</Callout>
