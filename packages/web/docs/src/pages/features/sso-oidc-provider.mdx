# Single Sign On via Open ID Connect Provider

GraphQL Hive allows you to connect any Open ID Connect provider (e.g. Okta, Auth0 or Google
Workspaces) to your organization. This allows you to use then existing Open ID Connect provider to
authenticate and automatically add your users to your Organization. Users signing into your
organization will be automatically added to your organization and will be able to access all the
resources that you have granted them access to. Users that sign using the Open ID Connect provider
will only be scoped to that organization and incapable of creating personal organizations or joining
any other organizations.

## Connecting the Open ID Connect Provider

<Callout>Your Open ID Connect provider needs to support the `email` claim capability.</Callout>

Visit your organization `Settings` and click on the `Connect Open ID Connect Provider` button.

Alternatively you can visit the following link (and replace `<your-organization-name>` with your
organization name):

`https://app.graphql-hive.com/<your-organization-name>/settings#manage-oidc-integration`

For the form fill in the following information:

**OAuth API Url.** The OAuth API url of your Open ID Connect provider. This is the url that you use
to sign into your Open ID Connect provider. For example `https://trial-xxxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/v1`if
you are using Okta as your OIDC provider.

**Client ID.** The client id of your Open ID COnnect provider.

**Client Secret.** The client id of your Open ID COnnect provider.

Connect the provider by clicking on the `Connect OIDC Provider` button.

## Configuring your Open ID Connect Provider

After creating the Open ID Connect Provider the `Manage OpenID Connect Integration` modal will
opened. Alternatively you can click the `Manage OIDC Provider` button on your organization settings
or open `http://app.graphql-hive.com/<your-organization-name>/settings#manage-oidc-integration`.

This page will show the `OIDC Provider Sign-in redirect URI` (e.g.
`https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/oidc`) and the `OIDC Provider Sign-out redirect URI`
(e.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/logout`). Go to the dashboard of your OIDC provider and set
these values as the `Sign-in redirect URI` and `Sign-out redirect URI` respectively.

## Login via Open ID Connect Provider

After creating the Open ID Connect Provider the `Manage OpenID Connect Integration` modal will
opened. Alternatively you can click the `Manage OIDC Provider` button on your organization settings
or open `http://app.graphql-hive.com/<your-organization-name>/settings#manage-oidc-integration`.

That page shows the login URL that your users can utilize for logging in via the Open ID Connect
Provider. Share this link with your users or add it to your SSO provider dashboard (e.g. Okta), so
people will be redirected to it.

E.g. `https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/oidc?id=xxxxxxxx-1234-1234-1234-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Configuring with Okta

Once you're logged in to your account, click the "Admin" button in the header to navigate to the
admin view.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/okta-admin-button.webp)

After you're redirected click on the "Applications" tab in the sidebar then click on the "Create App
Integration" button

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/okta-create-app-integration.webp)

Choose "OIDC - OpenID Connect" as for the Sign-in method and "Web Application" for the "Application
type", then click "Next".

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/create-new-app-integration-options.webp)

Next you're gonna be able to customize your app's name and logo if you want to, then choose the
option that suits you for the "Controlled access", I'm gonna go with "Allow everyone" as this's just
a guide, after you're done click "Save".

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/controlled-access-of-okta-app.webp)

And now you're almost good to go with Okta's configuration, now head to your Hive organization
settings tab and hit the "Connect Open ID Connect Provider" button

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-connect-openid-provider.webp)

And now you'd have to fill in a couple of inputs to connect your OpenID Okta's provider as the
following:

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-connect-openid-provider-modal.webp)

- Token Endpoint = https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE/oauth2/v1/token (ex:
  https://trial-5517233.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token)
- User Info Endpoint = https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE//oauth2/v1/userinfo (ex:
  https://trial-5517233.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo)
- Authorization Endpoint = https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN_HERE//oauth2/v1/authorize (ex:
  https://trial-5517233.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize)
- Client ID = ![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/okta-app-config-client-id.webp)
- Client Secret = ![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/okta-app-config-client-secret.webp)

After you're done, click the "Connect OIDC Provider" button.

The last step to do is, grabbing both the OIDC provider sign-in and sign-out redirect URIs by
clicking the copy button next to them, then go back to your Okta's app SSO configuration and scroll
down to the "General Settings" section and click "Edit" on the right, then scroll down to the
"LOGIN" section and paste both the Sign-in redirect URI and the Sign-out redirect URI from Hive into
their responding inputs and click "Save" when you're done.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-manage-openid-connect-modal.webp)

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/okta-app-general-settings-section.webp)

And congrats, you now have Okta connected! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

You can use the link provided in the modal right section to let your users login via Okta.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-openid-login-url.webp)

Hope that helped, and let us know if something changed on either Okta's or Hive's side in the
screenshots and/or steps and we'll make that change happen.

## Configuring with Azure AD

After you're logged in, search from the search bar at the top "azure active directory" then click on
it from the search results. On the left sidebar, click on the "Enterprise applications" under the
"Manage" section

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-enterprise-applications.webp)

Then click on the "New Application" button and then click on the "Create your own application"
button afterwards, you're gonna see the panel on the right where you should provide a name and
select "Register an application to integrate with Azure AD (App you're developing)" as for the
application purpose, then hit the "Create" button.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-new-application-button.webp)
![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-create-application-panel.webp)

And now the last step to register your app is to define "Who can use this application or access this
API?" according to your needs, then choose "Web" as for the selecting the platform and input
"https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth/callback/oidc" in the input next to it, and finally click
"Register".

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-register-application.webp)

Once you see the successfully created application popup, go back to your enterprise applications by
navigating through the history structure from the top, then navigate to the "App registrations" tab
from the right sidebar, and now you're gonna see your app in the applications list, so click on your
app.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-go-back-after-app-registeration.webp)
![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-after-going-back-choose-tab-in-sidebar.webp)

And from here, we now have most of the configuration details needed by Hive for SSO connection, so
now head to your Hive's organization settings tab and hit the "Connect Open ID Connect Provider"
button

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-connect-openid-provider.webp)

And now you'd have to fill in a couple of inputs to connect your OpenID Azure AD's provider.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/hive-connect-openid-provider-modal.webp)

Use the pointers in the screenshot to help you find your credentials to be able to fill Hive's
connection inputs:

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-app-creds.webp)

- Token Endpoint = From the screenshot above
- User Info Endpoint = https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo
- Authorization Endpoint = From the screenshot above
- Client ID = From the screenshot above
- Client Secret = Create a new client secret for your app by navigating as the screenshot
  illustrates then on the right panel add a description for your secret and configure your
  expiration configuration or leave it as the default recommended value which is "6 months", then
  click "Add". ![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-app-new-client-secret.webp) Copy
  your clien secret value and paste it in Hive
  ![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-client-secret-value.webp)
  > Make sure to copy the value immediately, as you're not gonna be able to see it again after
  > navigating.

After you're done, click the "Connect OIDC Provider" button.

And we're almost done, go to the "Authentication" tab and scroll done to the "Front-channel logout
URL" section, and fill in the input with the following URL "https://app.graphql-hive.com/logout",
then click "Save"

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-configure-logout-url.webp)

And for the last step, we need to add the permissions for Azure AD to be able to access the user
info after authentication, so you're gonna go to "API permissions" then click the "Add a permission"
button, you're gonna see a right panel, choose "Microsoft Graph" then "Delegated permissions". And
make sure to add all of the listed permissions by using the search bar and checking the checkboxes:

- `email`
- `openid`
- `profile`
- `User.read`

After you're done, click the "Add permissions" button.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-configure-api-permissions.webp)
![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-configure-api-permissions-graph.webp)
![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-delegated-permissions.webp)

An Important Note:

<Callout type="info">
  Granting the permission for `email` unfortunately doesn't guarantee a successful login, because
  how Azure AD works is that emails are optional which is problematic for Hive as an email is what
  makes a login successful, so make sure when adding user records to add their email field as well
  so that they're able to login. Azure made it extra annoying because the only way to add an email
  is by editing an existing user not when creating a user record, but it is what it is. You can
  follow the steps in the screenshots below to be able to add an email for a user record.

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-users-tab.webp)

![](/docs/pages/features/sso-oidc-provider/azure-ad-edit-user-email-field.webp)

</Callout>

And congrats, you now have Azure AD connected! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

You can use the link provided in the modal right section to let your users login via Azure AD.
