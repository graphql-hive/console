# Checking schema

Once you have published the schema, one of the next steps would be to check your local (or Pull
Request) schema against the latest version.

Hive will give you a list of all changes, sorted by criticality level (Breaking, Dangerous, Safe)
and fail the check once breaking change is detected.

## Requirements

- An active [token](./tokens) with "Read" permissions to the Registry.
- [Published schema](./publish-schema)

## Using Hive CLI

To check a schema, use `hive schema:check` command:

```bash
# Single GraphQL API
# one file
hive schema:check schema.graphql
# glob pattern
hive schema:check "src/*.graphql"

# Federation and Stitching
hive schema:check --service reviews schema.graphql
```

<Callout>In case of Federation or Stitching it's mandatory to use `--service` an flag.</Callout>

## With `Usage` enabled

When [Operations Monitoring](./monitoring) is enabled, Hive is able to mark breaking changes as safe
based on data collected by Hive Client.

We call it Conditional Breaking Changes and the general idea is to let you decide when a breaking
change is in fact breaking.

## GitHub Integration

In case you want to integrate GraphQL Hive with your GitHub repository, follow the
[GitHub integration guide](./integrations#github).
