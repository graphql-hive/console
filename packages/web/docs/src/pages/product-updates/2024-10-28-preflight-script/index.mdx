We've added Preflight Scripts to Laboratory! These scripts allow you to automatically run custom
authentication processes before executing your GraphQL operations. They're especially useful for
handling authentication flows like OAuth, where you may need to refresh an access token. Let's
explore how it works.

export function Caption({ children }) {
  return <p className="text-center text-sm italic">{children}</p>
}

## Configuring Preflight Script

To create a script click on the command line icon (right after Operation Collections plugin icon) in
GraphiQL sidebar section.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Caption>The preflight script is accessible by clicking on the Command line icon in the GraphiQL sidebar</Caption>

You will see Script editor (JavaScript language) which is read-only and present for a quick view of
your saved script and Environment variables editor (JSON language) which is persistent in
localStorage.

## Editing Preflight Script

Clicking on the `Edit` button will open Modal where you can edit, test and save your script in
database.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note**: Your script will stored as plain text in our database, don't put any secrets there, use
  Environment variables editor for it! The preflight script is accessible to all members of your
  organization, but only users with access to target Settings can edit the script code.
</Callout>

You can use any JavaScript syntax (including top-level `await`) in the Script editor. Getting and
Setting environment variables is done by accessing the `environment` property on the `lab` global
variable.

```js
// get myKey variable from the Environment variables editor
lab.environment.get('myKey')
// set myKey variable to the Environment variables editor (persistent in localStorage)
lab.environment.set('myKey', myValue)
```

## CryptoJS

Additionally, you can access the CryptoJS library by accessing the `CryptoJS` property on the `lab`
global variable.

## Global Variables and Errors

Access to global variables such as `this`, `window` or `globalThis` is restricted. Errors thrown by the script will be displayed in Console Output.

## Using Environment Variables

To use your environment variables in GraphiQL headers editor wraps environment keys with
double-curly braces, e.g.:

```json filename="Headers" /{{myEnvVar}}/
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer {{myEnvVar}}"
}
```
