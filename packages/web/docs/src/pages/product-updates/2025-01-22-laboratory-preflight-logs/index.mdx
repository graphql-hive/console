Weâ€™ve added a **Preflight Script Logs Panel** in Laboratory to make debugging and tracking preflight
script execution easier.

When a preflight script is enabled, a new collapsible panel appears in the query editor, giving you
**visibility into the logs generated by your preflight scripts during query execution**.

The panel stays out of your way while you test queries but is ready when you need it. Just click to
expand and view the logs. You can also clear the logs anytime to keep things tidy.

Give it a try and share your feedback with us! ðŸš€
