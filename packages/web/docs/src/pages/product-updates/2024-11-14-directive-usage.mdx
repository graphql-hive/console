We're excited to announce that the Hive Schema Registry now supports custom directives!

Hive offers enhanced support for custom directives, allowing users to easily detect changes in
directive usage within GraphQL schemas. This feature greatly improves the capabilities of schema
diffing, enabling comprehensive tracking of modifications related to custom directives across
different schema versions.

## Rules for Custom Directives

Support for custom directives covers various schema elements, including:

- SCHEMA
- SCALAR
- OBJECT
- FIELD_DEFINITION
- ARGUMENT_DEFINITION
- INTERFACE
- UNION
- ENUM
- ENUM_VALUE
- INPUT_OBJECT
- INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

## Example

```graphql filename="OLD_SCHEMA"
input Foo {
  a: String
  b: String
}
```

```graphql filename="NEW_SCHEMA"
directive @anyNameDirective on INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
input Foo {
  a: String @anyNameDirective
  b: String
}
```
