title: Added a Conditional Breaking Change Static Threshold
description:
  A minor improvement to our conditional breaking changes behavior that allows changes to be
  considered breaking based on a minimum number of requests.

Expect a lot of improvements to the Hive Schema Registry in 2025.

One of the first updates this year is a small but potentially very useful option for
[Conditional Breaking Changes](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/management/targets#conditional-breaking-changes).
Previously, Conditional Breaking Changes checked compatibility against all operations called in the
past number of days. If the percent impacted exceeded the configured percentage threshold, then the
change would be considered breaking. Unfortunately for schemas with disproportionate operation
usage, an operation with very little percent usage could still have a major impact to their
consumers.

To better handle this case, a new option has been added to set a static threshold for the total
number of operations that can be incompatible before the change is considered breaking.

So if you were using a 0% threshold but found it a bit too restrictive, considered this new option
to set a higher static threshold.
