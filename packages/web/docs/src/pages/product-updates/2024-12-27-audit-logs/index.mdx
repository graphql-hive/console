We've added audit logs to Hive!

Audit logs help you understand the occurrence of an event (e.g. configuration change) caused by user
actions. This helps having a detailed record of activities and transactions for accountability,
security, compliance and troubleshooting.

Organization admins can perform an audit log export within the organization settings. Once the
export is completed, it will be sent to the admins email address.
