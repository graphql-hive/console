# Collections

Collections help you organize and manage your GraphQL operations. Think of them as folders where you can group related operations together for better project management and team collaboration.

## What are Collections?

Collections are named groups of operations that you can:

- **Organize by feature** - Group operations related to a specific feature or API area
- **Share with team** - Collections can be shared across your organization
- **Quick access** - Quickly find and open operations you use frequently
- **Version control** - Keep track of operations as your API evolves

## Creating Collections

To create a new collection:

1. Open the Collections panel from the left sidebar
2. Click the "+" button or use the Command Palette (`⌘J`) and select "Add collection"
3. Enter a name for your collection
4. Click "Add collection"

The collection will appear in the Collections panel and is ready to store operations.

## Adding Operations to Collections

### From an Operation

When you have an operation open:

1. Click the "Save" button (bookmark icon) in the operation toolbar
2. Select the collection from the dropdown
3. The operation is now saved to that collection

The bookmark icon will show as "Saved" when the operation is already in a collection.

### From Collections Panel

You can also add operations directly:

1. Open the Collections panel
2. Right-click on a collection (or use the collection menu)
3. Select "Add operation"
4. Create a new operation or select an existing one

## Managing Collections

### Viewing Collections

The Collections panel shows:

- **Collection name** - Click to expand/collapse
- **Operation count** - Number of operations in each collection
- **Operation list** - All operations within the collection

### Opening Operations

To open an operation from a collection:

1. Expand the collection in the Collections panel
2. Click on any operation
3. It will open in a new tab

If the operation is already open, clicking it will switch to that tab.

### Searching Collections

Use the search bar in the Collections panel to:

- **Find operations** - Search across all collections
- **Filter results** - See matching operations with their collection names
- **Quick access** - Click search results to open operations

Search results show operations in the format: `Collection Name / Operation Name`

### Deleting Collections

To delete a collection:

1. Hover over the collection in the Collections panel
2. Click the delete icon that appears
3. Confirm the deletion

**Warning:** Deleting a collection will also delete all operations within it.

### Deleting Operations from Collections

To remove an operation from a collection:

1. Expand the collection
2. Hover over the operation
3. Click the delete icon
4. Confirm the deletion

This removes the operation from the collection but doesn't delete the operation itself if it's open in a tab.

## Organizing Your Collections

### Best Practices

1. **Group by feature** - Create collections for different features or API areas
   - Example: "User Management", "Product Catalog", "Analytics"

2. **Group by team** - Organize by team or project
   - Example: "Frontend Team", "Mobile App", "Admin Tools"

3. **Group by environment** - Separate operations for different environments
   - Example: "Development", "Staging", "Production"

4. **Use descriptive names** - Clear names make collections easy to find
   - Good: "Authentication Queries"
   - Bad: "Stuff"

### Naming Conventions

Consider establishing naming conventions for your team:

- Use consistent prefixes or suffixes
- Include dates for time-sensitive collections
- Add version numbers for API versions
- Use emoji or icons for visual organization (if supported)

## Sharing Collections

Collections can be shared across your organization:

- **Team access** - All team members can see and use shared collections
- **Consistent operations** - Ensure everyone uses the same operation definitions
- **Onboarding** - New team members can quickly access common operations

Note: Sharing behavior depends on your Hive organization settings and permissions.

## Collections vs. Operations

Understanding the difference:

- **Operations** - Individual GraphQL queries, mutations, or subscriptions
- **Collections** - Groups of related operations

An operation can exist:
- Independently in a tab (not saved to any collection)
- In one or more collections
- Both in a collection and open in a tab

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `⌘J` / `Ctrl+J` - Open Command Palette (includes collection actions)

## Permissions

Collection management may be restricted based on your permissions:

- **Create** - Ability to create new collections
- **Delete** - Ability to delete collections
- **Update** - Ability to modify collection contents

If you don't have certain permissions, some actions may be disabled or hidden.

## Troubleshooting

### Collection Not Appearing

If a collection doesn't appear:

1. Refresh the Collections panel
2. Check if you have permission to view it
3. Verify the collection wasn't deleted

### Operation Not Saving

If you can't save an operation:

1. Check if you have permission to create operations in collections
2. Verify the collection exists
3. Try creating a new collection

### Search Not Working

If search doesn't find operations:

1. Check your search term spelling
2. Verify operations are actually in collections
3. Try refreshing the panel
