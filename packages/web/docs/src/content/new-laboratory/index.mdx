The Laboratory is Hive's powerful GraphQL playground that provides a comprehensive environment for
exploring, testing, and experimenting with your GraphQL APIs. Whether you're developing new queries,
debugging issues, or sharing operations with your team, the Laboratory offers all the tools you
need.

## Overview

The Laboratory combines the best features of a GraphQL IDE with advanced capabilities for managing
operations, testing scripts, and organizing your work. It's designed to be both powerful for
experienced developers and approachable for those new to GraphQL.

## Key Features

### Operations

Create and execute GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions with full syntax highlighting,
auto-completion, and validation. The Laboratory supports all GraphQL operation types and provides
real-time feedback.

### Schema Support

Automatically introspect your GraphQL schema and use the visual Builder to explore available types,
fields, and arguments. The schema-aware editor helps you build valid operations quickly.

### Collections

Organize your operations into collections for better project management. Group related queries
together, share collections with your team, and keep your workspace organized.

### Preflight Scripts

Run custom TypeScript scripts before executing operations. Use preflight scripts to modify headers,
set environment variables, perform authentication, or add any custom logic you need.

### Environment Variables

Manage environment-specific variables that can be used across all your operations. Perfect for
switching between development, staging, and production environments.

### History

Track all your operation executions with detailed response data, timing information, and error logs.
Review past requests to debug issues or understand API behavior.

## Getting Started
