# GraphQL Hive Technical Specifications

Federation `@link` compliant features for GraphQL Hive.

---

## Introduction

Links are a feature in Federation 2.x that allow external specifications to be referenced and used
by a subgraph. Hive uses links to allow schemas to opt in to schema related features, such as
metadata.

### Importing via `@link`

A preqrequisite is that the subgraph is using Federation 2.x:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/link/v1.0")
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3")
```

Then the Hive features can be imported like:

```graphql
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.graphql-hive.com/hive/v1.0", import: ["@meta"])
```

Be sure to import and add definitions for all resources you intend to use.

### Subgraph schema additions

```graphql
directive @meta(
  name: String!
  content: String!
) repeatable on SCHEMA | OBJECT | INTERFACE | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

## Features

### @meta

<Tabs items={["v1.0"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

Use this directive to enhance schema types with additional data, visible via the Hive Console. _This
intentionally does not appear in the API Schema to avoid bloat. But if you want this directive to be
returned to your gateway, then you can use `@composeDirective`_

```graphql
directive @meta(
  name: String!
  content: String!
) repeatable on SCHEMA | OBJECT | INTERFACE | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

Metadata is useful for indicating ownership, contact information, importance, domain, or more. It
can be viewed from Hive's explorer page:

import explorerMetadataViewImage from '../../../public/docs/pages/specs/link-specifications/explorer_metadata-view.png'

<NextImage
  alt="Explorer with Metadata Visible"
  src={explorerMetadataViewImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

And can be used in Hive's explorer page to filter the list of elements:

import explorerMetadataFilterImage from '../../../public/docs/pages/specs/link-specifications/explorer_metadata-filter.png'

<NextImage
  alt="Explorer with Metadata Filter"
  src={explorerMetadataFilterImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

#### Usage

`@meta` can be applied to schemas, types, interfaces, and fields. A field's metadata is a union of
all applied metadata. This is applied using the following rules:

1. meta on a schema applies to every field in the schema.
2. meta on a type applies to every field in that exact type.
3. meta on an interface applies to every field in that interface on every implemented type.
4. meta on a field applies only to that field for that type.
