# Telemetry / Error Handling

When self-hosting Hive, you can enable telemetry to help us understand how Hive is being used and
how we can improve it. Telemetry is disabled by default.

> By default, all services emits OpenTelemetry traces, except for the `usage` service. To enable
> this service, you need to set the `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=...` environment variable
> explicitly for this service.

## OpenTelemetry Traces

<Steps>

### Prepare your OpenTelemetry Backend

To enable [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces for your Hive instance, start by running
a OpenTelemetry Collector (or, a compatible service that can process OTLP traces, like DataDog or
Jaeger).

Hive supports sending traces to OTLP backend over HTTP protocol (port `4318`) only.

To setup a test [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) locally, you can
use the following configuration file and script to run it as a Docker image that just prints the
received traces:

```yaml filename="otel-local-config.yaml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
      grpc:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug

extensions:
  health_check: {}

service:
  extensions: [health_check]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logging]
```

Run the collector:

```
docker run \
  -v "${PWD}/otel-local-config.yaml":/otel-local-config.yaml \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \
  --config otel-local-config.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can use
[these following instructions for running a Grafana with Tempo service locally using Docker](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/getting-started/docker-example/).
In that case, use `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"` as the OTLP
endpoint.

### Configure Hive to send traces to the OTLP Collector

To instruct Hive to send traces to the OTLP Collector, you need to set the following environment
variable:

```
OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"
```

</Steps>

## OpenTelemetry Metrics

Hive supports exposing metrics in Prometheus format, using the scrapping technique.

To enable metrics, you need to set the following environment variable:

```
PROMETHEUS_METRICS=1
```

You should now configure your Prometheus server to scrape the metrics from Hive, using the `10254`
port and `/metrics` endpoint for each service.

Please check the `README` file of each service for additional configuration options.

## Sentry Error Reporting

Hive supports error reporting to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), a popular error tracking service.

To enable Sentry error reporting, start by gathering your
[Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/).

Then, set the following environment variables:

```
SENTRY_DSN=<YOUR_DSN_HERE>
SENTRY=1
```
