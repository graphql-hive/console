**TL;DR** We release Hive Gateway v1.0.0, a new GraphQL Federation Gateway that seamlessly
integrates with the Hive Schema Registry. [Check out our new Gateway documentation](/docs/gateway).

Hive Gateway is our fully open source and MIT-licensed GraphQL Gateway with native support for
GraphQL Federation.

Hive Gateway is built on top of our existing and widely used open-source packages such as GraphQL
Yoga and GraphQL Tools.

With Hive Gateway you get access to the following features, that are currently behind a paywall in
other gateway/router solutions.

- GraphQL Subscriptions
- Persisted Documents
- GraphQL API Usage and Analytics Reporting
- Authentication and Authorization
- Role-based Access Control
- Observability with Open Telemetry and Prometheus

We don't believe in gatekeeping essential features, and want to make them accessible to everyone.
