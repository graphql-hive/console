# Hive Integrations

We encourage everyone to help us with the developing and evolving Hive, since
[it's a full open-source project](https://github.com/graphql-hive/platform).

This section contains reference implementations for a number of different tools and languages.

## Specifications

In addition to these reference implementations, be sure to review our
[API Reference](/docs/api-reference) documentation. The information contained in pages is critical
for those interested in creating new implementations of the
[Hive Client](/docs/api-reference/client) library, building custom CI/CD integrations, or more.

If you wish to develop a new integration or a plugin for Hive, you may find following specifications
particularly helpful:

- [Publishing GraphQL schemas to Hive from a running service](/docs/api-reference/cli#publish-a-schema)
- [Usage Reporting to Hive](/docs/api-reference/usage-reports)
- [Public GraphQL API](/docs/api-reference/graphql-api)

## Future Integrations

We are tracking the process of development of new integrations using GitHub. Here's a list of
relevant issues, in case you wish to track, subscribe, or share your use-case:

- [Python Client for Graphene and Strawberry](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/issues/508)
- [Java Client for GraphQL-Java and DGS](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/issues/1430)

If you are looking for an integration that does not exists on that list, or you wish to collaborate
with us on the development of a new integration/plugin, please
[open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/issues/new).
