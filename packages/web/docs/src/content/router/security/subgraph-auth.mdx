# Subgraph Authentication

Subgraph Authentication allows you to secure communication between the Hive Router and your
subgraphs. You can follow this guide to set up how to sign subgraph requests.

By activating this, you can ensure that the requests send to GraphQL subgraphs is trusted and signed
by the Hive Router. In case of any missing signature, tampering or unauthorized access, the subgraph
services will reject the request.

## HMAC Signature

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a mechanism for calculating a message
authentication code involving a hash function in combination with a secret key. It can be used to
verify the integrity and authenticity of a message.

This feature implements HMAC signing for requests between Hive Router and the GraphQL subgraph. It
also provides HMAC verification plugin for the incoming requests in the subgraph services.

    end
```

### How to use?

<Steps>

#### Step 1: Gather your secret key

Before you start, you need to have a secret key that will be used for HMAC signing and verification.

The secret key should be a random, opaque string, that will be shared between the Hive Router and
the subgraphs validating the HMAC signature.

#### Step 2: HMAC Signing in Hive Router

```yaml
hmac_signature:
  enabled: true
  secret: 'myHMACSecret' # Use the secret key gathered in step 1
```

Now, every GraphQL request sent to the upstream GraphQL subgraphs will be signed with the HMAC and
the `extensions` of the upstream request will contain the HMAC signature.

To configure the subgraph verification of the HMAC signature, please follow the next step.

#### Step 3: HMAC Verification in Subgraph services

The next step is to perform a verification over the sent HMAC signature in the subgraph services:

##### With GraphQL Yoga

If you are using Yoga, you can use the following package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature
```

```ts
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useHmacSignatureValidation } from '@graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature'

const myYogaSubgraphServer = createYoga({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    useHmacSignatureValidation({
      secret: myHMACSecret // see step 1 for the secret key
    })
    // other Yoga plugins
    // ...
  ]
})
```

<Callout>
  Make sure to add `useHmacSignatureValidation` first in the plugins list in your Yoga
  configuration. This will ensure the request is verified before processing the other plugins.
</Callout>

##### With Apollo Server

If you are using Apollo-Server for your subgraph services, you can implement a custom plugin to
verify the HMAC signature. You can still use the utilities from the
`@graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature` library to serialize the request parameters and verify the
HMAC signature in a stable way.

Start by installing the `@graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature` package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature
```

Now, configure your Apollo Server with the HMAC verification plugin:

```ts filename="apollo-subgraph.ts"
import { createHmac } from 'crypto'
import { ApolloServer, ApolloServerPlugin } from '@apollo/server'
import { defaultParamsSerializer } from '@graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature'

const verifyHmacPlugin = {
  async requestDidStart({ request, contextValue }) {
    const signature = request.extensions?.['hmac-signature']

    if (!signature) {
      throw new Error('HMAC signature is missing')
    }

    const serializedParams = defaultParamsSerializer({
      query: request.query,
      variables: request.variables
    })

    const incomingReqSignature = createHmac('sha256', HMAC_SIGNING_SECRET)
      .update(serializedParams)
      .digest('base64')

    if (incomingReqSignature !== signature) {
      throw new Error('HMAC signature is invalid')
    }
  }
} satisfies ApolloServerPlugin<{}>

const server = new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    verifyHmacPlugin
    // ... other Apollo plugins
  ]
})
```

##### Other GraphQL servers

To implement HMAC verification in other GraphQL servers, you should implement a HMAC verification
using the following specification:

- The incoming request to your server will contain an `extensions` field with a `hmac-signature`
  key.
- The `hmac-signature` value is a `base64` encoded HMAC signature of the request parameters, using
  the SHA-256 algorithm.
- The request parameters should be serialized in a stable way, so the signature can be verified
  correctly. I should consist of the GraphQL `query` and `variables`:

  ```json
  {
    "query": "query { comments { id author { id name } } ",
    "variables": {}
  }
  ```

- The HMAC signature should be calculated using the secret key shared between the Hive Router and
  the subgraph services.

Here's an example of an incoming subgraph request with the HMAC signature:

```json
{
  "query": "query { comments { id author { id name } } ",
  "variables": {},
  "extensions": {
    "hmac-signature": "AbC123"
  }
}
```

> The signature is produced by the Hive Router using the shared secret key, and the serialized
> request (query and variables).

</Steps>
