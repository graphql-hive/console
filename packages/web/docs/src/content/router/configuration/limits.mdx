# limits

The `limits` configuration allows you to set various limits on incoming GraphQL requests to prevent
too large operations that could lead to overfetching or DOS attacks.

[Learn more about operation complexity and why limiting it is important](../security/operation-complexity).

## Options

### `max_depth`

This configuration allows you to set a maximum depth for incoming GraphQL queries. Queries that
exceed this depth will be rejected with an error. If not specified, there is no limit on query
depth.

#### `n`

- **Type:** `integer`

The maximum allowed depth for incoming GraphQL operations.

#### `disable_introspection`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

When set to `true`, introspection queries will not be exempt from the depth limit. This means that
introspection queries will also be subject to the maximum depth restriction. This is usually set to
`true` when you want to fully enforce depth limits, including for introspection queries. But be
aware that this may break tools that rely on introspection, because they often generate deep queries
to explore the schema.

#### `flatten_fragments`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

When set to `true`, the depth calculation will consider fragment spreads as if they were inlined.
This provides a more accurate depth measurement, especially when fragments are used extensively in
operations.

### `max_directives`

This option allows you to set a maximum number of directives allowed in incoming GraphQL operations.
Operations that exceed this number will be rejected with an error. If not specified, there is no
limit on the number of directives.

#### `n`

- **Type:** `integer`

The maximum allowed number of directives in incoming GraphQL operations.

### `max_tokens`

This option allows you to set a maximum number of tokens allowed in incoming GraphQL operations.
Operations that exceed this number will be rejected with an error. If not specified, there is no
limit on the number of tokens.

#### `n`

- **Type:** `integer`

The maximum allowed number of tokens in incoming GraphQL operations.

### `max_aliases`

This option allows you to set a maximum number of aliases allowed in incoming GraphQL operations.
Operations that exceed this number will be rejected with an error. If not specified, there is no
limit on the number of aliases.

#### `n`

- **Type:** `integer`

The maximum allowed number of aliases in incoming GraphQL operations.

## Examples

### Limit Query Depth to 2

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
limits:
  max_depth:
    n: 2
```

In that example, any incoming GraphQL operation that exceeds a depth of 2 will be rejected with an
error.

```graphql
query {
  user {
    posts {
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above query has a depth of 3 (`user` -> `posts` -> `comments`), so it would be rejected.

### Limit Directives to 5

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
limits:
  max_directives:
    n: 5
```

In that example, any incoming GraphQL operation that contains more than 5 directives will be
rejected with an error.

```graphql
query {
  user @include(if: true) {
    posts @skip(if: false) {
      comments @include(if: true) {
        text @skip(if: false)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above query contains 4 directives, so it would be accepted. If an operation contained more than
5 directives, it would be rejected.

### Limit Tokens to 10

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
limits:
  max_tokens:
    n: 10
```

In that example, any incoming GraphQL operation that contains more than 10 tokens will be rejected
with an error.

```graphql
query {
  user {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

The above operation contains 8 tokens, so it would be accepted. If an operation contained more than
10 tokens, it would be rejected.

### Limit Aliases to 3

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
limits:
  max_aliases:
    n: 3
```

In that example, any incoming GraphQL operation that contains more than 3 aliases will be rejected
with an error.

```graphql
query {
  user1: user {
    id
  }
  user2: user {
    name
  }
}
```

The above operation contains 2 aliases (`user1` and `user2`), so it would be accepted. If an
operation contained more than 3 aliases, it would be rejected.

```graphql
query {
  user1: user {
    id
  }
  user2: user {
    name
  }
  user3: user {
    email
  }
  user4: user {
    age
  }
}
```

The above query contains 4 aliases (`user1`, `user2`, `user3`, and `user4`), so it would be
rejected.
