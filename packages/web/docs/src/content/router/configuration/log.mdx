# log

The `log` configuration object allows you to control the logging behavior. Proper log configuration
is essential for monitoring the router's health, debugging issues, and gaining insight into its
operations in both development and production environments.

You can control the verbosity, format, and filtering of the logs generated by the router.

## Options

### `level`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `info`

The `level` property controls the verbosity of the logs. By default, the router is configured to be
mostly silent at the `info` level, emitting only important operational messages, warnings, and
errors.

The available log levels, from most verbose to least, are:

- `trace`: Highly detailed diagnostic information for deep debugging.
- `debug`: Detailed information useful for tracking the flow of requests.
- `info`: General operational information (e.g., server startup messages).
- `warn`: Potentially harmful situations or warnings that do not stop execution.
- `error`: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.

### `format`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `json`

The `format` property determines the structure of the log output.

- `json` (Default): Outputs logs in a structured JSON format. This is the **recommended format for
  production** as it allows for easy parsing, filtering, and ingestion by log management systems
  (e.g., Datadog, Splunk, ELK stack).
- `pretty-tree`: A human-readable, multi-line, tree-like format that is useful for local development
  and debugging. It is not recommended for production.
- `pretty-compact`: A more compact, single-line, human-readable format, also intended for
  development.

### `filter`

- **Type:** `string`

The `filter` property provides advanced, fine-grained control over which log messages are emitted
based on their origin (e.g., a specific module within the router) and their level. This can be used
to reduce noise or focus on a particular area of the router without changing the global log level.

The syntax is a comma-separated list of `target=level` directives. For most use cases, adjusting the
global `level` is sufficient.

## Examples

### Production Logging

This is a typical configuration for a production environment, logging only informational messages
and above in a machine-readable JSON format.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
log:
  level: 'info'
  format: 'json'
```

### Development Logging

This configuration is useful for local development, providing more verbose debug output in a
human-readable format.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
log:
  level: 'debug'
  format: 'pretty-compact'
```
