# Configuration reference

You can configure Hive Router using a YAML, JSON, or TOML file (by default, `router.config.yaml`).
We'll use YAML for all examples in this documentation since it's the most readable.

Some configuration variables can be overridden at runtime using
[environment variables](./environment-variables).

This page covers all the main configuration options available. Each option links to a detailed page
that explains how to use that feature.

- [`authorization`](./configuration/authorization): Define field-level access control using
  directives.
- [`cors`](./configuration/cors): Control cross-origin requests to your API.
- [`csrf`](./configuration/csrf): Protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
- [`headers`](./configuration/headers): Modify HTTP headers between clients and subgraphs.
- [`http`](./configuration/http): Set the host and port for your router.
- [`jwt`](./configuration/jwt): Add JWT-based authentication to secure your endpoint.
- [`log`](./configuration/log): Control what the router logs and how it formats log messages.
- [`override_subgraph_urls`](./configuration/override_subgraph_urls): Route requests to different
  subgraph URLs dynamically.
- [`override_labels`](./configuration/override_labels): Dynamically activate or deactivate
  progressive override labels.
- [`query_planner`](./configuration/query_planner): Add safety limits and debugging for query
  planning.
- [`supergraph`](./configuration/supergraph): Tell the router where to find your supergraph schema.
- [`traffic_shaping`](./configuration/traffic_shaping): Manage connection pooling and request
  handling to subgraphs.
- [`telemetry`](./configuration/telemetry): Configure tracing and usage reporting to Hive Console.
- [`introspection`](./configuration/introspection): Enable and disable introspection queries for
  added security.
- [`limits`](./configuration/limits): Set limits on operation cost, depth, and other factors to
  protect your API.
