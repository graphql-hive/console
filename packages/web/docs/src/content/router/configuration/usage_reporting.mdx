# usage_reporting

The `usage` configuration object allows you to control over how the Hive Router does
[usage reporting](../../schema-registry/usage-reporting) to Hive Console.

## Options

### `token`

- **Type:** `string`

Your
[Registry Access Token](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/management/targets#registry-access-tokens)
with write permission.

Alternatively, you can set the `HIVE__USAGE_REPORTING__TOKEN` environment variable to provide the
token.

### `target_id`

- **Type:** `string`

A target ID, this can either be a slug following the format
“$organizationSlug/$projectSlug/$targetSlug” (e.g “the-guild/graphql-hive/staging”) or an UUID (e.g.
“a0f4c605-6541-4350-8cfe-b31f21a4bf80”). To be used when the token is configured with an
organization access token.

Alternatively, you can set the `HIVE__USAGE_REPORTING__TARGET_ID` environment variable to provide
the target ID.

### `endpoint`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage`

For self-hosting, you can override `/usage` endpoint (defaults to
`https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage`).

### `sample_rate`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** `1.0`

A value between `0.0` and `1.0` that indicates the percentage of requests to be reported. For
example, a value of `0.1` means that approximately 10% of requests will be reported, while a value
of `1.0` means that all requests will be reported.

### `exclude`

- **Type:** `string[]`
- **Default:** `[]`

A list of operations (by name) to be ignored by Hive. For example, if you want to exclude
introspection queries, you can add `"IntrospectionQuery"` to this list.

### `client_name_header`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `graphql-client-name`

The name of the HTTP header from which to read the client name for usage reporting. This is useful
if you want to identify different clients consuming your GraphQL API.

### `client_version_header`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `graphql-client-version`

The name of the HTTP header from which to read the client version for usage reporting. This is
useful if you want to identify different versions of clients consuming your GraphQL API.

### `buffer_size`

- **Type:** `integer`
- **Default:** `1000`

A maximum number of operations to hold in a buffer before sending to Hive Console. When the buffer
reaches this size, it will be flushed and sent to Hive Console.

### `accept_invalid_certs`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

If set to `true`, the Hive Router will accept invalid SSL certificates when sending usage reports.
This can be useful for self-hosted Hive instances using self-signed certificates.

### `connect_timeout`

- **Type:** `integer`
- **Default:** `5`

A timeout for only the connect phase of a request to Hive Console, in seconds.

### `request_timeout`

- **Type:** `integer`
- **Default:** `15`

A timeout for the entire request to Hive Console, in seconds.

### `flush_interval`

- **Type:** `integer`
- **Default:** `5`

The interval in seconds at which the usage report buffer is flushed and sent to Hive Console.
