# supergraph

The `supergraph` configuration tells the router where to find your federated supergraph schema. This
schema is the blueprint of your entire federated graph - it contains information about all your
subgraphs and how they connect together.

> For additional information about the supergraph loading and reloading process in Hive Router, see
> [Supergraph page](../supergraph).

## Hive Console

### `source`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Value:** `"hive"`

Load the Supergraph schema from [Hive Console](../../schema-registry) CDN.

### `endpoint`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Environment Variable:** `HIVE_CDN_ENDPOINT`

The [_Hive CDN Endpoint_](../../schema-registry/get-started/apollo-federation#cdn-access) of your
target.

```yaml {3} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  endpoint: https://cdn.graphql-hive.com/artifacts/v1/...
  # ...
```

### `key`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Environment Variable:** `HIVE_CDN_KEY`

The [_Hive CDN key/token_](../../schema-registry/management/targets#creating-a-cdn-access-token) of
your target.

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  key: hvABCD
```

### `poll_interval`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `10s`
- **Environment Variable:** `HIVE_CDN_POLL_INTERVAL`

A human-readable string representing the interval at which the router should poll Hive CDN for
changes.

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  poll_interval: 10s
```

### `request_timeout`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `60s`

A human-readable string representing the request timeout for Hive CDN requests.

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  timeout: 60s
```

### `connect_timeout`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `10s`

A human-readable string representing the connection timeout for Hive CDN requests.

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  connect_timeout: 10s
```

### `retry_policy`

- **Type:** `{ max_retries: number }`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `{ max_retries: 10 }`

Max retries amount for Hive CDN requests. Exponential backoff is used to calculate the delay between
retries.

```yaml {4-5} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  retry_policy:
    max_retries: 10
```

### `accept_invalid_certs`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `false`

If set to `true`, allows accepting invalid TLS certificates when connecting to Hive CDN. Useful for
development or testing environments.

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: hive
  # ...
  accept_invalid_certs: false
```

## Filesystem

The most straightforward way to provide your supergraph schema is as a local file. This works well
for development and production deployments where you manage the schema file directly.

### `source`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Value:** `"file"`

Load the schema from a local file.

### `path`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Environment Variable:** `SUPERGRAPH_FILE_PATH`

Path to your supergraph schema file. Can be absolute or relative to where you're running the router.

```yaml {3} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
```

This loads the schema from a file called `supergraph.graphql` in the same directory as your config
file.

### `poll_interval`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** disabled

A human-readable string representing the interval at which the router should poll the file for
changes.

The reloading process depends on the file system's ability to detect changes based on the
file-system metadata (modified-at attribute).

```yaml {4} filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
  poll_interval: 10s
```
