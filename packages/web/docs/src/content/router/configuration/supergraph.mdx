# supergraph

The `supergraph` configuration tells the router where to find your federated supergraph schema. This
schema is the blueprint of your entire federated graph - it contains information about all your
subgraphs and how they connect together.

## File Source

The most straightforward way to provide your supergraph schema is as a local file. This works well
for development and production deployments where you manage the schema file directly.

### Options

#### `source`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Value:** `"file"`

Load the schema from a local file.

#### `path`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes

Path to your supergraph schema file. Can be absolute or relative to where you're running the router.

### Example

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
```

This loads the schema from a file called `supergraph.graphql` in the same directory as your config
file.
