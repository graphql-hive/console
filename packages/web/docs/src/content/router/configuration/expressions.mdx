# Expressions

The Hive Router uses **expressions** written in
[VRL (Vector Remap Language)](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/) to make dynamic decisions at
runtime. VRL is a small, declarative language originally created by DataDog for the
[Vector observability pipeline](https://vector.dev/) and is well‑suited for parsing and transforming
structured data. In Hive Router, expressions let you:

- [Route requests to different subgraph URLs](../guides/dynamic-subgraph-routing) based on HTTP
  headers, geographic region or other request metadata.
- [Insert, modify or remove HTTP headers](../guides/header-manipulation) before forwarding a request
  to a subgraph or before sending a response back to the client.

Although the concept of "expressions" appears in several parts of the configuration, the syntax and
available APIs are consistent. This page explains **what variables and functions are available, when
different variables can be used**, and links you to the official VRL documentation for the full
language reference.

## Syntax overview

Every expression evaluates to a value, and you can build more complex logic using functions and
control‑flow. For example:

```
if .request.headers."x-feature-toggle" == "beta" {
  "https://beta.example.com/graphql"
} else {
  .original_url
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can break long expressions across multiple lines using the `|` indentation in YAML.
</Callout>

VRL supports [variables](#available-variables) (prefixed with a dot), built‑in
[functions](#available-functions), simple arithmetic and comparisons, and control structures such as
`if … else`.

Multi‑line expressions are especially useful for readability and complex routing logic.

## Available values

Within an expression you interact with a few top‑level values. The most important ones are:

### `.request`

Represents the incoming HTTP request. It exposes nested fields such as:

- `.request.headers` - a case‑insensitive map of request headers. For example,
  `.request.headers.authorization` gives you the value of the `Authorization` header.
- `.request.method` - the HTTP method as a lowercase string (e.g. `"post"`).
- `.request.url.host` - the request host (e.g. `api.example.com`).
- `.request.url.port` - the request port (e.g. `443`).
- `.request.url.path` - the request path (e.g. `/graphql`).
- `.request.operation.name` - the name of the GraphQL operation being executed, if provided.
- `.request.operation.type` - the type of GraphQL operation being executed (e.g. `"query"`,
  `"mutation"`, or `"subscription"`).
- `.request.operation.query` - the full GraphQL query string being executed.

These values allow you to branch logic based on who is calling your API and what data they send.

### `.response`

Available only in **response** header rules. It represents the HTTP response from a subgraph call.
You can inspect `.response.url` or `.response.headers` and then set or override additional headers.
For example, you could conditionally add a cache header based on the subgraph’s status code. This
variable is not present when computing request headers or dynamic URLs, because the response does
not yet exist.

- `.response.headers` - a case‑insensitive map of response headers.

### `.subgraph`

Available in both **request** and **response** header rules. It provides metadata about the subgraph
handling the current request, including:

- `.subgraph.name` - the name of the subgraph as defined in your supergraph schema.

### `.timestamp`

While not a full object, the special variable `.timestamp` yields the current UNIX timestamp. The
header manipulation guide demonstrates using `.timestamp` to add a `X‑Request‑Time` header. This is
useful for debugging and tracing requests.

### `.original_url`

This variable is only available in [dynamic routing expressions](./override_subgraph_urls). It holds
the default URL for the current subgraph, as declared in your supergraph schema. Because the
expression must return a URL, you should always provide a fallback using `.original_url` so that
requests are routed somewhere when no condition matches. The configuration reference emphasises this
by showing a pattern where the expression returns `.original_url` in the `else` branch.

## Available functions

The Hive Router exposes the full set of
[VRL built‑in functions](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/functions/). The configuration guides
use a few of them in examples:

- `replace(value, pattern, replacement)` - returns a new string with all matches of pattern
  replaced. In the header manipulation guide it's used to normalise an `Authorization` header by
  stripping existing prefixes.
- `contains(value, substring)` - tests whether a string contains a substring.
- `random_int(min, max)` - produces a random integer in the inclusive range. Combined with `if` to
  create percentage‑based canary routing of subgraphs.
- `lowercase(value)`, `uppercase(value)`, `split(value, delimiter)`, `to_int(value)` - helpful for
  normalising and parsing header values.

For a complete list of functions - including string manipulation, number conversion, JSON parsing,
and more - see the [VRL function reference](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/functions/). When
writing expressions, you can call any of these functions directly.

<Callout type="warning">
  Functions that could perform network I/O (e.g. HTTP requests) are intentionally not available, so
  expressions remain side‑effect‑free and deterministic.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

When an expression doesn't work as expected, it can be due to a compilation error (syntax) or a
runtime error (evaluation). The Hive Router provides detailed logs to help you diagnose the issue.

### Compilation Errors

Compilation errors occur if your expression has invalid VRL syntax. The router will fail to start
and log an error message pointing to the problematic expression. Common syntax errors include
mismatched parentheses, missing commas, or incorrect function names.

### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors happen when a syntactically correct expression fails during execution. These are
logged by the router during a request. The router will also return an error response to the client.

Here are some frequent causes of runtime errors in expressions:

1. **Accessing an unavailable variable**: Expressions run in specific contexts. For example, trying
   to access `.response` in a request header rule will fail because the response from the subgraph
   doesn't exist yet.
1. **Type Mismatches**: VRL is strongly typed. If you try to perform an operation on incompatible
   types, like comparing a string with an integer, you'll get a runtime error.
1. **Handling `null` values**: Accessing a non-existent header or field returns `null`. Operations
   on `null` values can lead to errors. Always check for the existence of a value or provide a
   fallback. You can use the `||` operator to provide a default value (e.g.,
   `.request.headers."x-custom-header" || "default-value"`).

[VRL error reference](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/errors).
