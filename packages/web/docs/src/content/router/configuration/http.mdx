# http

The `http` configuration object allows you to customize the network interface and port that the Hive
Router listens on for incoming GraphQL requests.

## Options

### `host`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `"0.0.0.0"`
- **Environment Variable:** `HOST`

The `host` property specifies the IP address to which the router's HTTP server will bind.

- `"0.0.0.0"`: Binds to all available network interfaces. This is the standard for services running
  inside containers.
- `"127.0.0.1"` or `"localhost"`: Binds only to the local loopback interface, meaning the router
  will only be accessible from the same machine.

### `port`

- **Type:** `integer`
- **Default:** `4000`
- **Environment Variable:** `PORT`

The `port` property specifies the network port that the router will listen on. Ensure this port is
not already in use by another service on the same host. When running in a container, this is the
port you will need to expose.

### `graphql_endpoint`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `/graphql`

The `graphql_endpoint` property specifies the URL path at which the router will expose its GraphQL
API.

You may also use `/graphql/{wildcard}` if you wish to capture nested paths within the same request,
or `/graphql/{tail}*` to capture any remaining path segments.

## Example

This example configures the router to listen only on the localhost interface on port `8080` and on
path `/my_graphql_router`, so it will accept GraphQL requests on
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/my_graphql_router`.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
http:
  host: '127.0.0.1'
  port: 8080
  graphql_endpoint: /my_graphql_router
```
