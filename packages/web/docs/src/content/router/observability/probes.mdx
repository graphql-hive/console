## Liveness (health) check

Liveness (health) of Hive Router is available at `/health` endpoint, and represents the HTTP health status of the router.

A request to this endpoint will return a `200 OK` status code if the router is healthy.

If a container fails its liveness probe repeatedly, the runtime environment should restart or replace the container with a new one.

To manually check your router's health status, you can send an HTTP GET request to the `/health` endpoint. For example, using `curl`:

```bash
# Replace the URL with your Router's host and port
curl -I http://localhost:4000/health
```

<Callout type="warning" className="mb-4">

The Liveness/health check only represents the validity of the router's HTTP layer.

See **Readiness check** below for a more comprehensive health check that represents the ability of the router to process and execute GraphQL requests.

## Readiness check

Readiness of Hive Router is available at `/readiness` endpoint, and represents the readiness status and ability to process GraphQL requests.

The readiness check depends on your [Supergraph](./supergraph) load status. A router instance that has not loaded the supergraph yet will return a `503 Service Unavailable` status code. Once the supergraph is loaded, the router will return a `200 OK` status code.

In cases where the initial Supergraph was loaded successfully, and reloading of the Supergraph is failing, the router will continue to report `200 OK` status code, to prevent the runtime from restarting or replacing the instance, which might have a cascading effect.

To manually check your router's readiness status, you can send an HTTP GET request to the `/readiness` endpoint. For example, using `curl`:

```bash
# Replace the URL with your Router's host and port
curl -I http://localhost:4000/readiness
```
