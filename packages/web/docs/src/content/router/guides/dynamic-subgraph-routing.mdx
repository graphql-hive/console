# Dynamic Subgraph Routing

Sometimes you need to route requests to different instances of the same subgraph based on the
request properties - maybe for testing new versions, handling different regions, or managing load.
Hive Router lets you change where requests go dynamically using simple logic expressions.

This guide shows you practical ways to use dynamic routing in real-world scenarios. For the complete
configuration reference, see
[`override_subgraph_urls` configuration](../configuration/override_subgraph_urls).

## How It Works

Dynamic routing uses [expressions](../configuration/expressions) to decide where to send requests.
For each request, the router evaluates your expression and routes to the URL it returns.

**What you have access to:**

- `.request` - The incoming HTTP request (headers, method, etc.)
- `.default` - The default URL from your supergraph schema

Simple example configuration that routes based on a runtime condition:

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
override_subgraph_urls:
  subgraph_name:
    url:
      expression: |
        if .router.headers."x-use-special-instance" == "true" {
          "https://special-instance.com/graphql"
        } else {
          .default  # Always provide a fallback
        }
```

## Examples

To illustrate how dynamic routing can be used, here are some common scenarios, along with example
configurations.

### Canary Deployments

One of the most common use cases for dynamic routing is canary deployment. This pattern allows you
to roll out a new version of a subgraph to a small, controlled subset of traffic before releasing it
to all users.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
override_subgraph_urls:
  products:
    url:
      expression: |
        if .request.headers."x-deploy-track" == "canary" {
          "https://products-canary.example.com/graphql"
        } else {
          .default
        }
```

With this configuration, your QA team or CI/CD pipeline can test the new deployment in production by
simply adding the `X-Deploy-Track: canary` header to their requests, without affecting regular
users.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
override_subgraph_urls:
  products:
    url:
      expression: |
        # Route 10% of traffic to canary
        if random_int(1, 100) <= 10 {
          "https://products-canary.example.com/graphql"
        } else {
          .default
        }
```

### Regional Routing

If your application is deployed globally, you likely have subgraph instances in multiple geographic
regions. Routing users to the instance closest to them can significantly reduce latency.

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
override_subgraph_urls:
  reviews:
    url:
      expression: |
        region = .request.headers."x-user-region" || "unknown"

        if region == "us-east" {
          "https://reviews-us-east.example.com/graphql"
        } else if region == "eu-west" {
          "https://reviews-eu-west.example.com/graphql"
        } else if region == "asia-pacific" {
          "https://reviews-ap.example.com/graphql"
        } else {
          # Default to primary region
          .default
        }
```
