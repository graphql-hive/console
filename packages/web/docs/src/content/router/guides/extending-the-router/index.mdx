# Extending the Router

Hive Router is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize its behavior to fit
your specific needs. This guide demonstrate how to extend the router's functionality using
[custom plugins written in Rust](../extensibility/plugin_system).

Refer also to the
[technical documentation and the API reference of the Router plugin system](../extensibility/plugin_system).

## Creating a Custom Plugin

Hive Router is built using Rust, which allows for high performance and safety. One of the powerful
features of Hive Router is the ability to create custom builds with your own Rust plugins. This
enables you to add new capabilities or modify existing ones to better suit your requirements.

<Steps>

### Create a new Rust project

First, ensure you have the necessary development environment set up for
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).

Then, start by creating a new Rust project for your custom router:

```bash
cargo new --bin my_custom_router
cd my_custom_router
```

### Install Dependencies

Install `hive-router` and `serde` as a dependency by adding it to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
hive-router = "<HIVE_ROUTER_VERSION>" # see https://crates.io/crates/hive-router for latest version
serde = "1"
```

### `main` and router entrypoint

Next, you need to create an entrypoint for your custom router. This is where you'll initialize the
router and register your plugins. Create a new file `src/main.rs` and add the following code:

```rust
use hive_router::{
    configure_global_allocator, RouterGlobalAllocator,
    error::RouterInitError, init_rustls_crypto_provider, router_entrypoint,
    PluginRegistry,
};

// Configure the global allocator that's used by Hive Router
configure_global_allocator!();

#[hive_router::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), RouterInitError> {
    // Configure TLS so your router will be able to make HTTPS requests
    // By default, Router is using the system's default certificate store.
    init_rustls_crypto_provider();

    // Start the Hive Router with the plugin registry
    router_entrypoint(PluginRegistry::new()).await
}
```

### Configure your Router

To use the Router, you'll need to create a `router.config.yaml` file in the root of your project.

This file will contain the configuration for your router, including the supergraph source and any
plugins you want to use.

Also, this configuration file needs to point to a valid, composed, Supergraph file.

If you already have your own Supergraph that can be used for testing, then place it in your
development directory. Alternatively, you can use our example supergraph as a starting point:

```bash
curl -sSL https://federation-demo.theguild.workers.dev/supergraph.graphql > supergraph.graphql
```

Then, point to your Supergraph in your `router.config.yaml`:

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
```

> Hive Router allows you to load the Supergraph for additional source, refer to
> [Supergraph Sources documentation page](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/router/supergraph).

### Run your custom router

At this point, you should be able to run your router by executing the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

The Router default configuration is to serve at port `4000`, so go ahead and try to open
[`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) in your browser to see the GraphQL
interactive playground.

### Create a custom plugin

Now you can create a custom plugin by implementing the
[`RouterPlugin` trait](../extensibility/plugin_system).

Then, create a `src/plugin.rs` file with the following template:

```rust
use hive_router::{
    async_trait,
    plugins::{
        hooks::{
            on_graphql_params::{OnGraphQLParamsStartHookPayload, OnGraphQLParamsStartHookResult}, on_plugin_init::{OnPluginInitPayload, OnPluginInitResult}
        },
        plugin_trait::{RouterPlugin, StartHookPayload},
    },
};

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct MyPlugin;

#[async_trait]
impl RouterPlugin for MyPlugin {
    type Config = ();

    fn plugin_name() -> &'static str {
        "my_plugin"
    }

    fn on_plugin_init(payload: OnPluginInitPayload<Self>) -> OnPluginInitResult<Self> {
        payload.initialize_plugin_with_defaults()
    }

    async fn on_graphql_params<'exec>(
        &'exec self,
        payload: OnGraphQLParamsStartHookPayload<'exec>,
    ) -> OnGraphQLParamsStartHookResult<'exec> {
        println!("Received GraphQL operation: {:?}", payload.graphql_params.query);

        payload.proceed()
    }
}
```

The plugin above uses the [Plugin System Hooks API](../extensibility/plugin_system#hooks), and hooks
into `on_graphql_params` phase, to print the received GraphQL operation to the log.

> You can find a plugin template in the
> [Router GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/blob/main/plugin_examples/plugin_template/src/plugin.rs).

### Register your plugin

Now, register your plugin in the `main.rs`:

```diff
use hive_router::{
    error::RouterInitError, init_rustls_crypto_provider, ntex, router_entrypoint,
    RouterGlobalAllocator, configure_global_allocator, PluginRegistry,
};
+ mod plugin;
+ use plugin::MyPlugin;

configure_global_allocator!();

#[hive_router::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), RouterInitError> {
    init_rustls_crypto_provider();

    router_entrypoint(
        PluginRegistry::new()
+            .register::<MyPlugin>()
    ).await
}
```

### Enable and configure your plugin

Now that you have registered your plugin, the Router can start using it, and as a user of the
router, you'll need to enabled configure your plugin in the `router.config.yaml` file:

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
plugins:
  my_plugin:
    enabled: true
```

### Try your plugin

You can now compile and run your Router again:

```bash
cargo run
```

And use the interactive GraphQL playground at
[`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to run any query. If your plugin is
registered, configured an enabled correctly, running any GraphQL operation will print a log message
as defined in `on_graphql_params` hook of the custom plugin.

> This simplest GraphQL operation you can run that doesn't require subgraphs runnning is:
> `query { __typename }`.

### Build your Router

Now that you have a custom plugin that extends the Router behavior, you'll need to compile it in
Release mode in order to be able to use is in production.

To do that, verify that your `Cargo.toml` file has a defined binary and entrypoint:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "hive_router_with_my_plugin" # Name of the binary
path = "src/main.rs"
```

And then use Rust compiler in release mode:

```rust
cargo build --release
```

Your artifact will now be located in `./target/release/hive_router_with_my_plugin` and you can run
it as-is.

### Distribute your custom Router

We recommend wrapping your custom Router with a Docker image, and build it using a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile name="Dockerfile"
# Use the official Rust image as the base image
# Please consider to pin the Rust version
FROM rust:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire project into the container
COPY . .

# Build the project in release mode
RUN cargo build --release

# Expose the port that the router will run on
EXPOSE 4000

# Run the custom router binary
CMD ["./target/release/hive_router_with_my_plugin"]
```

Then, run the following Docker build command:

```bash
docker build -t my-custom-router .
```

After the image is built, you can run a container from it:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -v ./supergraph.graphql:/app/supergraph.graphql \
  -v ./router.config.yaml:/app/router.config.yaml \
  my-custom-router
```
