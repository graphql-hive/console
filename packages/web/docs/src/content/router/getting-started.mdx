# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up Hive Router from scratch. We'll go from zero to a working
GraphQL API that you can query locally. By the end, you'll have a router serving a federated
supergraph with real data.

## Installation

Hive Router comes as a standalone binary or Docker image. For trying things out locally, the binary
is usually the quickest option. For production deployments, you'll probably want the Docker image.

<Tabs items={["Docker Container", "Binary"]} >

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

Pull the official Docker image:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/graphql-hive/router:latest
```

> We recommend using a pinned version number, instead of `latest`, for any non-development environment.
>
> You can find the list of available versions on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/releases) page.

This downloads the right binary for your operating system:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphql-hive/router/main/install.sh | sh
```

> Right now we have pre-built binaries for Linux and macOS. Windows users should use the Docker
> option below.

Check out the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/graphql-hive/router/releases) page for all
available versions.

## Get a Sample Schema

For this guide, we'll use a demo supergraph schema. It's the same one from our
["Get Started with GraphQL Federation"](../schema-registry/get-started/apollo-federation#prerequisites)
guide.

This schema combines three demo subgraphs:
[users](https://federation-demo.theguild.workers.dev/users),
[products](https://federation-demo.theguild.workers.dev/products), and
[reviews](https://federation-demo.theguild.workers.dev/reviews).

Download the schema file:

```sh
curl -sSL https://federation-demo.theguild.workers.dev/supergraph.graphql > supergraph.graphql
```

> **What's a supergraph?** Think of it as a combined schema that merges all your individual subgraph
> schemas into one unified graph. The router uses this to figure out which subgraphs to talk to for
> each query.

## Configure the Router

Create a config file called `router.config.yaml` that tells the router where to find your schema:

```yaml filename="router.config.yaml"
supergraph:
  source: file
  path: ./supergraph.graphql
```

That's it for basic setup. The router will load your supergraph schema from that file. For additional configuration options, see the [Supergraph configuration](./supergraph) page.

## Start the Router

Now let's fire it up:

<Tabs items={["Docker Container", "Binary"]} >

{/* Docker */}

<Tabs.Tab>

Mount your files and run the container:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -v ./supergraph.graphql:/app/supergraph.graphql \
  -v ./router.config.yaml:/app/router.config.yaml \
  ghcr.io/graphql-hive/router:latest
```

</Tabs.Tab>

{/* Binary */}

<Tabs.Tab>

Run the router with your config:

```sh
./hive_router
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

If everything works, you'll see logs showing the server starting up on port `4000`.

## Try It Out

Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to access the GraphQL IDE. Try running this query to
see federation in action:

```graphql
query TopProducts {
  topProducts {
    name
    reviews {
      body
      author {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query spans multiple subgraphs - it gets product data from the products service, review data
from the reviews service, and user data from the users service. The router handles all the
coordination behind the scenes.

## What's Next?

Now that you have the router running, dive into the [Configuration Reference](./configuration) to
see all the ways you can customize it for your specific needs.
