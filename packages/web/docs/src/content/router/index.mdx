# Introduction to Hive Router

Hive Router is a high-performance [GraphQL Federation](/federation) router built with Rust. It
serves as the entry point for GraphQL requests in your federated setup, routing them efficiently
across your subgraph services.

## Why Hive Router?

When you're running a [federated GraphQL architecture](/federation), your router becomes one of the
most important pieces of your infrastructure. It needs to be fast, reliable, and handle real-world
production traffic without breaking a sweat. Here's what makes Hive Router a solid choice:

- **Speed matters.** Built with Rust, Hive Router is designed for performance and minimal resource
  usage. Your API calls won't get bogged down by router overhead.
- **Production-ready.** Rust's safety guarantees mean you get a router that handles concurrency well
  and won't crash under heavy load.
- **Open source, no strings attached.** MIT licensed and fully open source. Use it anywhere, modify
  it however you need, and avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Feature-complete.** Get security, traffic management, and modern federation features without
  hunting for plugins or add-ons.
- **Built-in observability.** Send traces to Hive Console or OTLP-compatible backends with
  OpenTelemetry support.

## Performance Benchmarks

We've put Hive Router through its paces against other federation gateways to see how it performs
under real-world conditions.

See the full results and testing methodology:

## Federation Compatibility

Hive Router works with the standard GraphQL Federation specification. We run comprehensive tests to
make sure it plays nicely with the rest of the federation ecosystem.
