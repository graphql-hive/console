# Integration with NestJS

[Nest (Nest JS)](https://nestjs.com) is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient,
reliable and scalable server-side applications.

Hive Gateway provides its own Nest GraphQL Driver that supports building
[GraphQL Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) gateways.

<Callout>
  For the setup of a new Nest project, please make sure to read the [Nest GraphQL
  documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start).
</Callout>

## Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @nestjs/graphql @graphql-hive/nestjs graphql
```

## Create Application Module

```typescript
import { HiveGatewayDriver, HiveGatewayDriverConfig } from '@graphql-hive/nestjs'
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<HiveGatewayDriverConfig>({
      driver: HiveGatewayDriver,
      // All configuration for Hive Gateway comes here;
      supergraph: './supergraph.graphql',
      // Install subscription handlers to the server
      installSubscriptionHandlers: true,
      subscriptions: {
        // Enable WebSocket subscriptions
        'graphql-ws': true
      }
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

<Callout>
  Learn more about subscriptions in Hive Gateway [here](/docs/gateway/subscriptions).

## Further development

Hive Gateway offers just a gateway driver; meaning, everything else works as
[showcased in Nest federation documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/federation).
