# Integration with Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a web framework that allows you to build websites very quickly and
Hive Gateway can be integrated with Next.js easily as
[a custom route handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers).

## Example

Please read the https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers first.

```ts
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway-runtime'
import { supergraph } from './my-supergraph'

const { handleRequest } = createGatewayRuntime({
  supergraph,
  graphqlEndpoint: '/api/graphql'
})

export { handleRequest as GET, handleRequest as POST, handleRequest as OPTIONS }
```
