# Deduplicate Inflight Requests

Most of the time, your Hive Gateway will receive multiple requests for the same data. This can
happen when multiple clients request the same data, or when a single client sends multiple requests
for the same data.

To reduce the load on your downstream services, you can deduplicate the requests. This means that if
multiple requests for the same data are received at the same time, only one request will be sent to
the downstream service, and the responses will be shared among the clients.

This feature is enabled by default in Hive Gateway! If you would like to disable it, you can disable
it like this:

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import { HTTPTransportOptions } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  transportEntries: {
    '*.http': {
      options: {
        deduplicateInflightRequests: false
      } as HTTPTransportOptions
    }
  }
})
```
