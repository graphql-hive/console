title: Progressive Override

# Progressive Override

As a supergraph evolves, you often need to move fields from one subgraph to another. For example,
imagine you are migrating the `status` of an `Order` from a general `orders` subgraph to a new, more
specialized `fulfillment` subgraph.

## Feature Flag Approach

The `@override` directive in Apollo Federation is used for this, but making this change for all
traffic at once can be risky. Progressive override allows for a safer, incremental migration by
using a `label` on the directive:

```graphql filename="fulfillment-subgraph.graphql"
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.7", import: ["@key", "@override"])

type Order @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  # The "use-fulfillment-service" label controls this override
  status: String! @override(from: "orders", label: "use-fulfillment-service")
}
```

When a label like `"use-fulfillment-service"` is "active" for a request, the gateway will resolve
`Order.status` from the new `fulfillment` subgraph. When it's inactive, it will continue to use the
original `orders` subgraph.

The `progressiveOverride` configuration in the gateway is the mechanism that determines which labels
are active for any given request.

```ts filename="gateway-config.ts"
import { defineConfig, type GatewayContext } from '@hive/gateway'

export default defineConfig({
  progressiveOverride(label: string, context: GatewayContext) {
    if (label === 'use-fulfillment-service') {
      // Activate for 10% of requests
      return Math.random() < 0.1
      // Or based on an environment variable
      return process.env.USE_FULFILLMENT_SERVICE === 'true'
      // Or based on a header
      return context.request.headers.get('X-Use-Fulfillment-Service') === 'true'
    }
  }
})
```

## Percentage Approach

You can use the built-in `percent(x)` label to gradually roll out overrides based on a percentage of
requests without the need of any custom logic.

```graphql filename="fulfillment-subgraph.graphql"
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.7", import: ["@key", "@override"])

type Order @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  # The "percent" label controls this override
  status: String! @override(from: "orders", label: "percent(25)")
  # Now 25% of requests will use the fulfillment subgraph for Order.status
}
```
