# Disable Introspection

A powerful feature of GraphQL is schema introspection. This feature is used by GraphiQL for
exploring the schema and also by tooling such as
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for generating type-safe
client/frontend code.

GraphQL schema introspection is also a feature that allows clients to ask a GraphQL server what
GraphQL features it supports (e.g. defer/stream or subscriptions).

However, you may want to not expose your schema to the outside world. You can disable schema
introspection with the `disableIntrospection` option.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  disableIntrospection: {
    disableIf: () => true
  }
})
```

  If your goal is to avoid unknown actors from reverse-engineering your GraphQL schema and executing
  arbitrary operations, it is highly recommended to use [persisted
  operations](/docs/gateway/persisted-documents).

## Disable Introspection based on the GraphQL Request

Sometimes you want to allow introspectition for certain users. You can access the `Request` object
and determine based on that whether introspection should be enabled or not. E.g. you can check the
headers.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts" {6}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  disableIntrospection: {
    disableIf: ({ context }) => {
      return context.request.headers.get('x-allow-introspection') !== 'secret-access-key'
    }
  }
})
```

## Blocking Field Suggestions

When executing invalid GraphQL operation the GraphQL engine will try to construct smart suggestions
that hint typos in the executed GraphQL document. This can be considered a security issue, as it can
leak information about the GraphQL schema, even if introspection is disabled.

Tools like [Clairvoyance](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance) can exploit the smart
suggestions and brute-force obtaining the GraphQL schema even if the introspection has been
disabled.

[Enabling the `blockFieldSuggestions` option](/docs/gateway/other-features/security/block-field-suggestions)
will disable these smart suggestions and therefore prevent schema leaking.

Combined with the `disableIntrospection` option, you can make your schema more secure.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts" {7}
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  disableIntrospection: {
    disableIf: () => true
  },
  blockFieldSuggestions: true
})
```
