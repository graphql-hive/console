# Max Depth

**Limit** the **depth** of a GraphQL document. It is used to prevent too large queries that could
lead to overfetching or **DOS attack**.

## Basic Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  Powered by [GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-depth).
</Callout>

Hive Gateway ships with the basic "max depth" security features. You can enable it by setting the
`maxDepth` option to `true` or configure the allowed depth by passing a `number` to the option.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  maxDepth: true // defaults to 6
})
```

## Advanced Configuration

The built-in configuration options are limited and should be enough for most use-cases. However, if
you need more control, you can configure more by installing the
[GraphQL Armor Max Depth plugin](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-depth/).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-depth
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { maxDepthPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-depth'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    maxDepthPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Depth threshold | default: 6
      n: 6,
      // Do you want to propagate the rejection to the client? | default: true
      propagateOnRejection: true,
      // List of queries that are allowed to bypass the plugin
      allowList: [],

      /* Advanced options (use here on your own risk) */

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is accepted
      onAccept: [],

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is rejected
      onReject: []
    })
  ]
})
```
