# Max Tokens

**Limit** the number of **tokens** in a GraphQL document. It is used to prevent **DOS attack**,
**heap overflow** or **server overloading**. The token limit is often limited by the GraphQL parser,
but this is not always the case and would lead to a fatal heap overflow.

## Basic Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  Powered by [GraphQL Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-tokens).
</Callout>

Hive Gateway ships with the basic "max tokens" security features. You can enable it by setting the
`maxTokens` option to `true` or configure the amount of allowed tokens by passing a `number` to the
option.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  maxTokens: true // defaults to 1000
})
```

## Advanced Configuration

The built-in configuration options are limited and should be enough for most use-cases. However, if
you need more control, you can configure more by installing the
[GraphQL Armor Max Tokens plugin](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/max-tokens/).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-tokens
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { maxTokensPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-max-tokens'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    maxTokensPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Number of tokens allowed | Default: 5000
      n: 5000,
      // Do you want to propagate the rejection to the client? | default: true
      propagateOnRejection: true,
      // List of queries that are allowed to bypass the plugin
      allowList: [],

      /* Advanced options (use here on your own risk) */

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is accepted
      onAccept: [],

      // Callbacks that are ran whenever a Query is rejected
      onReject: []
    })
  ]
})
```
