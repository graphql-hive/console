# Block Field Suggestions

This is a feature that allows you to prevent **returning field suggestions** and **leaking your
schema** to unauthorized actors. In production, this can lead to leaking schema information even if
the introspection is disabled.

## Basic Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  Powered by [GraphQL
  Armor](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/block-field-suggestions/).
</Callout>

Hive Gateway ships with the basic "block field suggestion" security feature. You can enable it by
setting the `blockFieldSuggestions` option to `true`.

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  blockFieldSuggestions: true
})
```

## Advanced Configuration

The built-in configuration options are limited and should be enough for most use-cases. However, if
you need more control, you can configure more by installing the
[GraphQL Armor Block Field Suggestions plugin](https://escape.tech/graphql-armor/docs/plugins/block-field-suggestions/).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions
```

```ts filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions'
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: () => [
    blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin({
      // Toggle the plugin | Default: true
      enabled: true,
      // Mask applied to the error message | default: '[Suggestion hidden]'
      mask: '[Suggestion hidden]'
    })
  ]
})
```
