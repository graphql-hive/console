# Migrating Hive Gateway from v1 to v2

This document guides you through the process of migrating your Hive Gateway from version 1 to
version 2. It outlines the key changes, potential breaking points, and provides step-by-step
instructions to ensure a smooth transition.

v2 includes several breaking changes and improvements over v1. The most significant changes are:

- [Drop Support for Node v18](#drop-support-for-node-v18)
- [Multipart Requests are Disabled by Default](#multipart-requests-are-disabled-by-default)
- [Remove Mocking Plugin from built-ins](#remove-mocking-plugin-from-built-ins)
- [Disabled Automatic Forking](#disabled-automatic-forking)
- [Load Schema on CLI Start](#load-schema-on-cli-start)
- [Inflight Request Deduplication](#inflight-request-deduplication)
- [Hive Logger](#hive-logger)
- [OpenTelemetry](#opentelemetry)
- [Subgraph Name in Execution Request](#subgraph-name-in-execution-request)
- [Renamed CLI options for Hive Usage Reporting](#renamed-cli-options-for-hive-usage-reporting)
- [New Hive PubSub interface](#new-hive-pubsub-interface)

## Drop Support for Node v18

Node v18 has reached its end of life (as of 30 Apr 2025), and Hive Gateway v2, with it's
dependencies, no longer support it. The minimum Node version required to run Hive Gateway is now
Node v20.

The following packages have been updated to their latest versions, which require Node v20 or higher:

- `@graphql-hive/gateway`
- `@graphql-hive/gateway-runtime`
- `@graphql-mesh/fusion-runtime`
- `@graphql-mesh/hmac-upstream-signature`
- `@graphql-hive/plugin-deduplicate-request`
- `@graphql-mesh/transport-http-callback`
- `@graphql-hive/plugin-opentelemetry`
- `@graphql-tools/executor-graphql-ws`
- `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives`
- `@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus`
- `@graphql-hive/plugin-aws-sigv4`
- `@graphql-mesh/transport-common`
- `@graphql-tools/executor-common`
- `@graphql-mesh/plugin-jwt-auth`
- `@graphql-mesh/transport-http`
- `@graphql-tools/batch-delegate`
- `@graphql-tools/executor-http`
- `@graphql-tools/batch-execute`
- `@graphql-mesh/transport-ws`
- `@graphql-tools/federation`
- `@graphql-tools/delegate`
- `@graphql-hive/nestjs`
- `@graphql-hive/pubsub`
- `@graphql-tools/stitch`
- `@graphql-tools/wrap`

## Multipart Requests are Disabled by Default

The only objective of
[GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) is
to support file uploads; however, file uploads are not native to GraphQL and are generally
considered an anti-pattern.

To enable file uploads, you need to explicitly enable the multipart support by setting the
`multipart` Hive Gateway option to `true`.

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
+ multipart: true,
});
```

## Remove Mocking Plugin from built-ins

There is no need to provide the `useMock` plugin alongside Hive Gateway built-ins. Not only is the
mock plugin 2MB in size (minified), but installing and using it is very simple.

Migrating is very simple, start by installing the `@graphql-mesh/plugin-mock` package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-mesh/plugin-mock
```

and then use it in your Hive Gateway configuration:

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import {
  defineConfig,
- useMock
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway';
+ import { useMock } from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-mock'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    useMock({
      mocks: [
        {
          apply: 'User.firstName',
          faker: '{{name.firstName}}'
        }
      ]
    })
  ]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can read more about the mocking plugin in the [Mocking
  documentation](/docs/src/content/gateway/other-features/testing/mocking).
</Callout>

## Load Schema on CLI Start

Hive Gateway runtime is JavaScript environment agnostic, meaning it can run in Node.js, Deno,
Cloudflare Workers, Bun, and more. To achieve this, the schema loading needed to be handled on first
request or during the readiness check because the runtime is simply a request handler.

However, the CLI is a complete program that gets ran by the user; meaning, we do not have to load
the schema on-demand, we can load the schema on start! This helps catch schema issues early and
provides a better developer experience.

## Disabled Automatic Forking

We were previously forking workers automatically in v1 when detecting `NODE_ENV=production`;
however, forking workers for concurrent processing is a delicate process and if not done carefully
can lead to performance degradations. It should be configured with careful consideration by advanced
users.

In v2, the automatic forking of workers has been disabled by default. This means that the Hive
Gateway will no longer automatically create child processes to handle concurrent requests. Instead,
you can manually configure forking if needed.

You can configure forking in your `gateway.config.ts` file by using the `fork` option or using the
environment variable `FORK`. These options allow you to specify the number of worker processes to
fork.

## Inflight Request Deduplication

Hive Gateway ships with built-in inflight request deduplication. This means that if multiple
requests for the same resource are made simultaneously, Hive Gateway will only send one request to
the upstream service and share the response with all the original requesters.

Previously, you would use the suboptimal `useDeduplicateRequest()` plugin to achieve this
functionality. The plugin has been removed in v2, and the deduplication is now built-in and enabled
by default.

To migrate, simply remove the plugin from your configuration and you're good to go!

```diff
import {
  defineConfig,
- useDeduplicateRequest,
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- plugins: ctx => [useDeduplicateRequest(ctx)]
})
```

If you still want to use the deprecated plugin, you need to install it separately and use it as
before:

```sh
npm i @graphql-hive/plugin-deduplicate-request
```

```ts
import {
  defineConfig,
  useDeduplicateRequest,
  type HTTPTransportOptions, // only for typedefs, otherwise not necessary
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
import { useDeduplicateRequest } from '@graphql-hive/plugin-deduplicate-request'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  transportEntries: {
    '*.http': {
      options: {
        // disable the built in deduplication
        deduplicateInflightRequests: false,
      } as HTTPTransportOptions,
    },
  },
  plugins: ctx => [useDeduplicateRequest(ctx)]
})
```

## Hive Logger

The Hive Logger is a new feature in v2 that provides enhanced logging capabilities. It allows you to
log messages at different levels (info, debug, error) and provides a more structured way to handle
logs. The logger implementation now consistently uses the new `@graphql-hive/logger` package and
standardizes the logger prop naming and usage.

<Callout type="info">
  You can read more about the new logger and its features in the [Hive Logger
  documentation](/docs/logger) and how it works with Hive Gateway in [Logging and Error Handling
  documentation](/docs/gateway/logging-and-error-handling).
</Callout>

### Deprecating the Old Logger

The old logger interface from `@graphql-mesh/types` or `@graphql-mesh/utils`, the `DefaultLogger`
and the `LogLevel` enum have been deprecated and will be removed in the future, after all components
are migrated to the new logger.

```diff
- import { DefaultLogger, LogLevel } from '@graphql-mesh/utils';
- const logger = new DefaultLogger(undefined, LogLevel.debug);
+ import { Logger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';
+ const log = new Logger({ level: 'debug' });
```

Logging uses similar methods as before, with two significant changes:

1. The first, optional, argument of the logging methods are now the metadata
1. The message supports interpolation of all values succeeding the message

```diff
- logger.debug(`Hello ${'world'}`, { foo: 'bar' });
+ log.debug({ foo: 'bar' }, 'Hello %s', 'world');
```

### `logging` Configuration Option

The `logging` option has been changed to accept either:

1. `true` to enable and log using the `info` level
1. `false` to disable logging altogether
1. A Hive Logger instance
1. A string log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)

#### Changing the Log Level

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'Programmatic Usage']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import {
  defineConfig,
- LogLevel,
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- logging: LogLevel.debug,
+ logging: 'debug',
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```diff filename="index.ts"
import {
  createGatewayRuntime,
- LogLevel,
} from '@graphql-hive/runtime-gateway';

export const gateway = createGatewayRuntime({
- logging: LogLevel.debug,
+ logging: 'debug',
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

##### Dynamically Changing the Log Level

A great new feature of the Hive Logger is the ability to change the log level dynamically at
runtime. This allows you to adjust the verbosity of logs without restarting the application.

Please advise the
[Hive Logger documentation](/docs/gateway/logging-and-error-handling#change-dynamically) for more
details and an example.

#### Using a Custom Logger

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'Programmatic Usage']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import {
  defineConfig,
- DefaultLogger,
- LogLevel,
+ Logger,
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- logging: new DefaultLogger(undefined, LogLevel.debug),
+ logging: new Logger({ level: 'debug' }),
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

```diff filename="index.ts"
import {
  createGatewayRuntime,
- DefaultLogger,
- LogLevel,
+ Logger,
} from '@graphql-hive/gateway-runtime';

export const gateway = createGatewayRuntime({
- logging: new DefaultLogger(undefined, LogLevel.debug),
+ logging: new Logger({ level: 'debug' }),
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### The Environment Variable

Hive Logger will continue to support the `DEBUG=1` environment variable for enabling debug logging.

But, additionally, it supports the new `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable for setting a specific log
level. This allows you to control the log level without modifying the code or configuration files.

For example, setting `LOG_LEVEL=debug` will enable debug logging, while `LOG_LEVEL=warn` will set
the log level to "warn".

#### Logging in JSON Format

Previously, the Hive Gateway used two different environment variables to trigger loggin in JSON
format:

- `LOG_FORMAT=json`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

Both of those variables are now removed and replaced with `LOG_JSON=1`.

#### Pretty Logging

In addition to the JSON format, Hive Gateway had an additional `LOG_FORMAT=pretty` environment
variable that pretty-printed the logs. This variable has been removed.

When using the default logger, the logs are now pretty-printed by default. This means that the logs
will be formatted in a human-readable way, making it easier to read and understand.

Additionally, if you're using [the JSON format](#logging-in-json-format), you can use
`LOG_JSON_PRETTY=1` environment variable to enable pretty-printing the JSON logs.

### Prop Renaming `logger` to `log`

Throughout the codebase, the `logger` prop has been renamed to `log`. This change is part of the
standardization effort to ensure consistency across all components and plugins. The new `log` prop
is now used in all APIs, contexts, and plugin options. It's shorter and more intuitive, making it
easier to understand and use.

#### Context

The context object passed to plugins and hooks now uses `log` instead of `logger`. Basically, the
`GatewayConfigContext` interface has been changed to:

```diff filename="@graphql-hive/gateway"
- import type { Logger as LegacyLogger } from '@graphql-mesh/types';
+ import type { Logger as HiveLogger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

export interface GatewayConfigContext {
- logger: LegacyLogger;
+ log: HiveLogger;
  // ...rest of the properties
}
```

Same goes for all of the transports' contexts. Each of the transport contexts now has a `log` prop
instead of `logger`. Additionally, the logger is required and will always be provided.

```diff filename="@graphql-mesh/transport-common"
- import type { Logger as LegacyLogger } from '@graphql-mesh/types';
+ import type { Logger as HiveLogger } from '@graphql-hive/logger';

export interface TransportContext {
- logger?: LegacyLogger;
+ log: HiveLogger;
  // ...rest of the properties
}
```

##### Plugin Setup

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';
import { myPlugins } from './my-plugins';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  plugins(ctx) {
-   ctx.logger.info('Loading plugins...');
+   ctx.log.info('Loading plugins...');
    return [...myPlugins];
  },
});
```

##### Plugin Hooks

Across all plugins, hooks and contexts, the `logger` prop has been renamed to `log` and will always
be provided.

It is now the highly recommended to use the logger from the context at all times because it contains
the necessary metadata for increased observability, like the request ID or the execution step.

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- plugins({ log }) {
+ plugins() {
    return [
      {
        onRequest({ serverContext }) {
-         log.info('Got request...');
+         serverContext.log.info('Got request...');
        },
        onParams({ context }) {
-         log.info('Params...');
+         context.log.info('Params...');
        },
        onExecute({ context }) {
-         log.info('Executing...');
+         context.log.info('Executing...');
        },
        onDelegationPlan(context) {
-         log.info('Creating delegation plan...');
+         context.log.info('Creating delegation plan...');
        },
        onSubgraphExecute(context) {
-         log.info('Executing on subgraph...');
+         context.log.info('Executing on subgraph...');
        },
        onFetch({ context }) {
-         log.info('Fetching data...');
+         context.log.info('Fetching data...');
        },
        onResponse({ serverContext }) {
-         log.info('Responding...');
+         serverContext.log.info('Responding...');
        },
      },
    ];
  },
});
```

Will log with the necessary metadata for increased observability, like this:

```
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Executing...
  requestId: "0b1dce69-5eb0-4d7b-97d8-1337535a620e"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Creating delegation plan...
  requestId: "0b1dce69-5eb0-4d7b-97d8-1337535a620e"
  subgraph: "accounts"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Executing on subgraph...
  requestId: "0b1dce69-5eb0-4d7b-97d8-1337535a620e"
  subgraph: "accounts"
2025-04-10T14:00:00.000Z INF Fetching data...
  requestId: "0b1dce69-5eb0-4d7b-97d8-1337535a620e"
```

#### Affected Plugins

##### Prometheus i.e. `usePrometheus`

The monitoring plugin `usePrometheus` has been updated to use the new logger API. The `logger` prop
has been replaced with the `log` prop when using Hive Gateway runtime.

```diff filename="index.ts"
import { createGatewayRuntime } from '@graphql-hive/gateway-runtime'
import usePrometheus from '@graphql-mesh/plugin-prometheus'

export const gateway = createGatewayRuntime({
  plugins: ctx => [
    usePrometheus({
      ...ctx,
-     logger: ctx.logger,
+     log: ctx.log,
    })
  ]
})
```

If you have been using the `usePrometheus` plugin following the example from
[Monitoring and Tracing](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing#usage-example-1), where the `ctx` argument
is simply spread to the plugin options - you don't have to change anything.

#### Custom Transport

If you have implemented and been using a custom transport of yours, you will need to update the
`logger` prop to `log` in the `getSubgraphExecutor` method.

```diff filename="letter-transport.ts"
import type { Transport } from '@graphql-mesh/transport-common';
import { letterExecutor } from './my-letter-executor';

export interface LetterTransportOptions {
  shouldStamp?: boolean;
}

export default {
  getSubgraphExecutor(payload) {
-   payload.logger.info('Creating letter executor...');
+   payload.log.info('Creating letter executor...');
    return letterExecutor(payload);
  },
} satisfies Transport<LetterTransportOptions>;
```

### Custom Logger Writers

The new Hive Logger is designed to be extensible and allows you to create custom logger adapters by
implementing "log writers" instead of the complete logger interface. The `LogWriter` is simply:

```ts
import { Attributes, LogLevel } from '@graphql-hive/logger'

interface LogWriter {
  write(
    level: LogLevel,
    attrs: Attributes | null | undefined,
    msg: string | null | undefined
  ): void | Promise<void>
  flush?(): void | Promise<void>
}
```

As you may see, it's very simple and allows you, to not only use your favourite logger like pino or
winston, but also implement custom writers that send logs to a HTTP consumer or writes to a file.

<Callout type="info">
  Read more about implementing your own writers in the [Hive Logger documentation](/docs/logger).
</Callout>

### Pino (Node.js Only)

Use the [Node.js `pino` logger library](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for writing Hive Logger's
logs.

`pino` is an optional peer dependency, so you must install it first.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i pino pino-pretty
```

Since we're using a custom log writter, you have to install the Hive Logger package too:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-hive/logger
```

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import pino from 'pino'
- import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
- import { createLoggerFromPino } from '@graphql-hive/logger-pino'
+ import { defineConfig, Logger } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
+ import { PinoLogWriter } from '@graphql-hive/logger/writers/pino'

const pinoLogger = pino({
  transport: {
    target: 'pino-pretty'
  }
})

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- logging: createLoggerFromPino(pinoLogger)
+ logging: new Logger({
+   writers: [new PinoLogWriter(pinoLogger)]
+ })
})
```

### Winston (Node.js Only)

Use the [Node.js `winston` logger library](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for writing Hive
Logger's logs.

`winston` is an optional peer dependency, so you must install it first.

```sh
npm i winston
```

Since we're using a custom log writter, you have to install the Hive Logger package too:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-hive/logger
```

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston'
- import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
- import { createLoggerFromWinston } from '@graphql-hive/winston'
+ import { defineConfig, Logger } from '@graphql-hive/gateway'
+ import { WinstonLogWriter } from '@graphql-hive/logger/writers/winston'

const winstonLogger = createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: format.combine(format.timestamp(), format.json()),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
})

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- logging: createLoggerFromWinston(winstonLogger)
+ logging: new Logger({
+   writers: [new WinstonLogWriter(winstonLogger)]
+ })
})
```

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry integration have been re-worked to offer better traces, custom attributes and spans,
and overall compatiblity with standard OTEL API.

For this features to be possible, we had to break the configuration API of the old plugin and
release a brand new one `@graphql-**hive**/plugin-opentelemetry`. Everyone that has used the plugin
directly, you're advised to move away from the now deprecated
`@graphql-**mesh**/plugin-opentelemetry` and upgrade:

```diff
- @graphql-mesh/plugin-opentelemetry
+ @graphql-hive/plugin-opentelemetry
```

To upgrade, please read the new capabilities of the OpenTelemetry Tracing integration in the
[Hive Monitoring / Tracing documentation](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing).

### CLI Options

It is now possible to setup OpenTelemetry without a configuration file, by using the new
`--opentelemetry <exporter-endpoint>` option.

```bash
hive-gateway supergraph supergraph.graphql \
  --opentelemetry "http://localhost:4318"
```

By default, an HTTP OTLP exporter will be used. You can also use a GRPC one by using
`--opentelemetry-exporter-type`:

```bash
hive-gateway supergraph supergraph.graphql \
  --opentelemetry "http://localhost:4317" \
  --opentelemetry-exporter-type otlp-grpc
```

### SDK Setup

The OpenTelemetry SDK setup used to be automatically done by the plugin it self, it is no longer the
case. You have the choice to either setup it yourself using official `@opentelemetry/*` pacakges
(like official Node SDK `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`), or to use our cross-plateform setup helper
(recommended).

Extracting OTEL setup out of the plugin allows to you to decide on the version of `opentelemetry-js`
SDK you want to use.

Most of OTEL related settings have been moved to `openTelemetrySetup` options.

Please refer to
[OpenTelemetry Setup documentation](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing#opentelemetry-setup) for more
information.

### Tracing related configuration

All tracing related options has been moved to a `traces` option.

```diff filename="gateway.config"
import { defineConfig } from '@grahpl-hive/gateway'

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  openTelemetry: {
+   traces: {
      tracer: ...,
      spans: {
        ...
      }
+   }
  }
})
```

### Spans filter functions payload

The payload given as a parameter of the span filtering functions have been restrained.

Due to internal changes, the information available at span filtering time has been reduced to only
include (depending on the span) the GraphQL `context`, the HTTP `request` and the Upstream
`executionRequest`.

Please refere to [Request Spans documentation](/docs/gateway/monitoring-tracing#request-spans) for
details of what is availbe for each span filter.

### Span parenting

Spans are now parented correctly. This can have impact on trace queries used in your dashboard.

Please review your queries to not filter against `null` parent span id.

### New GraphQL Operation Span

A new span encapsulating each GraphQL operation has been added.

It is a subspan of the HTTP request span, and encapsulate all the actual GraphQL processing. There
can be multiple GraphQL operation spans for one HTTP request span if you have enabled graphql
operation batching over http.

### Root Context

The OpenTelemetry Context is now modified by Hive Gateway. The Context is set with the current phase
span. This means that if you were creating custom spans in your plugin without explicitly providing
a parent context, your spans will be considered sub-spans of Hive Gateway's current span.

To maintain your span as a root span, add an explicit parent context a creation time:

```diff
+ import { ROOT_CONTEXT } from '@opentelemetry/api'

export const myPlugin = () => ({
  onExecute() {
    myTrace.startActiveSpan(
      'my-custom-span',
      { foo: 'bar' },
+     ROOT_CONTEXT,
      () => {
        // do something
      }
    )
  }
})
```

## Subgraph Name in Execution Request

The targeted subgraph name is now exposed as a field of `ExecutionRequest`, it is no longer needed
to use `subgraphNameFromExecutionRequest` helper utility to find out which subgraph is targeted by
an execution request. Therefore, `subgraphNameFromExecutionRequest` has been removed, since it's no
longer needed.

```diff
- import { subgraphNameByExecutionRequest } from '@graphql-mesh/fusion-runtime';

const useMyPlugin = () => ({
  onFetch({ executionRequest }) {
-   const subgraphName = subgraphNameByExecutionRequest.get(executionRequest)
+   const subgraphName = executionRequest.subgraphName
  }
})
```

## Renamed CLI options for Hive Usage Reporting

To prepare for future observability features of Hive Console, `--hive-usage-target` has been
deprecated and you're recommended to use `--hive-target`. It will define the target for the
observability metrics _and_ usage reporting.

In addition to this change, we've added a new option `--hive-access-token` which is used to define
the token that's to be used for both observability and usage reporting.

```diff
hive-gateway supergraph \
  http://cdn.graphql-hive.com/<path>/supergraph \
  --hive-cdn-key "<hive_cdn_access_key>" \
- --hive-usage-target "<hive_usage_target>" \
- --hive-usage-access-token "<hive_usage_access_token>"
+ --hive-target "<hive_usage_target>" \
+ --hive-access-token "<hive_usage_access_token>"
```

## New Hive PubSub interface

The Hive PubSub package has been rewritten to provide a better developer experience and improved
support for asynchronous operations. The new interface is more intuitive and easier to use, making
it simpler to implement pub/sub functionality in your Hive Gateway.

It also unlocks the possibility of having a distributed subscriptions system, read
[Event-Driven Federated Subscriptions (EDFS)](/docs/gateway/subscriptions#event-driven-federated-subscriptions-edfs)
for more information.

The only breaking change relating to Hive Gateway is the renaming of `PubSub` to `MemPubSub` to
better reflect its in-memory nature. In case you have been using `PubSub`, you need to replace it
with `MemPubSub`:

```diff filename="gateway.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';
- import { PubSub } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';
+ import { MemPubSub } from '@graphql-hive/gateway';

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
- pubsub: new PubSub()
+ pubsub: new MemPubSub()
});
```

However, if you have been implementing your own pubsub system by implementing the `HivePubSub`
interface from `@graphql-hive/pubsub`, you need to update your implementation to match the
[new `PubSub` interface](/docs/gateway/subscriptions#pubsub). Advise the `@graphql-hive/pubsub`
changelog for exact migration steps upgrading from v1 to v2.
