# Moving from Registry Access Tokens to Access Tokens

On March 12, 2025, we introduced new Access Tokens managed at the Organization level as a
replacement for the Registry Access Tokens created at the Target level.

This guide will help you migrate existing registry access tokens to access tokens.

If you are experiencing any difficulties or questions please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We
are happy to help you along your journey.

## Key Differences

Registry access tokens were exclusively bound to a single Target. All actions performed with them
using the CLI (e.g., publishing a subgraph or checking a schema) were automatically executed on the
target they were created within.

The new organization-level access tokens do not have such an association but can be restricted to
specific resources (project, target, app deployment, or service) upon creation.

Because of that, the new access tokens **require passing a reference to the target** when performing
actions using the CLI or reporting usage data.

## Creating New Access Tokens

Please follow [our documentation for creating new access tokens](/docs/management/access-tokens).

When creating the access token, select the permissions for the actions you want to perform with this
access token. For example, if you want to publish a schema, select the
`Publish schema/service/subgraph` permission. permission. Instead, if you only want to check a
schema, select the `Create schema check` permission. The same applies for all other CLI actions.

<Callout>
  **Tip**: Follow the principle of least privilege by only selecting the scopes necessary for the
  token's purpose.
</Callout>

Within the `Resources` step, select the project and target in which you want to allow this action. A
new feature here is that you can now **restrict an access token to publishing a service with a
specific name**.

After you tested and replaced the old registry access token with the new access token, delete the
old registry access token.

## Performing Actions with the CLI

New access tokens require passing a reference to the target. When performing an action with the CLI,
you now need to pass a `--target` parameter, indicating on which target an action should be
performed

Please at upgrade to at least
[CLI version `0.49.0`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/releases/tag/%40graphql-hive%2Fcli%400.49.0).

**Note**: The new access tokens always start with the `hvo1/` prefix.

```diff filename="Publish Schema"
  hive schema:publish \
-    --registry.accessToken "...TRUNCATED..." \
+    --registry.accessToken "hvo1/...TRUNCATED..." \
+    --target "the-guild/graphql-hive/development" \
    --service users \
    users-subgraph.graphql
```

For the `--target` option, you can provide the slug as displayed on the Hive Console dashboard.

Retrieve the target slug from the Hive Console dashboard navigation. E.g.
`the-guild/graphql-hive/production`.

<NextImage
  alt="Target Slug on the Dashboard Navigation"
  src={targetSlugDashboard}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Alternatively, you can also provide the UUID of the target (e.g.
`a0f4c605-6541-4350-8cfe-b31f21a4bf80`). The UUID is more resilient to organization/project/target
slug adjustments. You can find it within the target settings or by hovering over the target slug
within the Hive dashboard.

If the provided access token has insufficient permissions on the provided target, an error message
will be printed when executing the command.

## Usage Data Reporting

Whether you are using Hive Gateway, Apollo Router, the Hive SDK (for Yoga or Apollo Server), or have
your own custom logic for sending usage data, small adjustments need to be made as you must include
the target to which the usage data is sent.

Ensure that the access token created for usage reporting contains the `Report usage data`
permission.

Retrieve the target slug from the Hive Console dashboard navigation, e.g.,
`the-guild/graphql-hive/production`.

<NextImage
  alt="Target Slug on the Dashboard Navigation"
  src={targetSlugDashboard}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Alternatively, you can also provide the UUID of the target (e.g.,
`a0f4c605-6541-4350-8cfe-b31f21a4bf80`). The UUID is more resilient to organization/project/target
slug adjustments. You can find it within the target settings or by hovering over the target slug
within the Hive dashboard.

### Hive Gateway

Please upgrade Hive Gateway to at least version
[`hive-gateway@1.10.4`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/releases/tag/hive-gateway%401.10.4).

Replace the usage of the `--hive-registry-token` config flag with the `--hive-usage-target` and
`--hive-usage-access-token` flags.

```diff
  hive-gateway supergraph \
    "<hive_cdn_endpoint>" \
    --hive-cdn-key "<hive_cdn_access_key>" \
-    --hive-registry-token "<hive_registry_token>"
+    --hive-usage-target "my-org/my-project/my-target" \
+    --hive-usage-access-token "hvo1/...TRUNCATED..."
```

### Hive SDKs

Providing the `target` for the usage reporting configuration is mandatory for the new access tokens.

### Apollo Router

Upgrade your docker image to at least
[`router2.0.0-plugin2.1.0`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/console/pkgs/container/apollo-router/370721851?tag=router2.0.0-plugin2.1.0)
or update the plugin to

if you are compling the router from source.

Adjust your `router.yml` file accordingly.

```yaml {6}
# ... other apollo-router configuration
plugins:
  hive.usage:
    enabled: true
    registry_token: 'hvo1/...TRUNCATED...'
    target: 'my-org/my-project/my-target'
```

Altenatively, the target can also be specified via the `HIVE_TARGET_ID` environment variable.

### Custom HTTP Implementation

The HTTP endpoint for the usage reporting changed for the new access tokens

```diff
- https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage
+ https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/<TARGET>
```

Retrieve the target slug from the Hive Console dashboard navigation, e.g.,
`the-guild/graphql-hive/production`.

<NextImage
  alt="Target Slug on the Dashboard Navigation"
  src={targetSlugDashboard}
  className="mt-10 max-w-2xl rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Using this slug the endpoint would be
`https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage/the-guild/graphql-hive/production`.

Alternatively, you can also use the target's UUID instead of the slug.

```diff
- https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage
+ https://app.graphql-hive.com/usage/<TARGET_UUID>
```

The `/usage/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/<TARGET>` and `/usage/<TARGET_UUID>` endpoints only support the
`X-Usage-API-Version: 2` specification.
