We want to:
- show incoming graphql requests
- show subgraph calls
- track parse / validation / planning steps as well
- annotate graphql requests with a list of subgraph names (so we can show operations that a subgraph is involved with)
- show performance of subgraph calls (latency, error rate - globally)
- capture errors in subgraph calls
- identify traces by client name and version
- attach http status
- attach http method
- attach http url
- attach custom attributes (like user id, header values, etc)
- attach query plan cache hit/miss
- attach queries
